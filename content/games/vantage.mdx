  <SideCard label="Like a Video Game" color="blue">
    <p>Jamey Stegmaier cites <strong>Breath of the Wild</strong>, <strong>Elden Ring</strong>, and <strong>Stardew Valley</strong> as inspirations. Think of Vantage as a tabletop open-world RPG — you explore, discover, and interact with the world at your own pace.</p>
  </SideCard>
  <SideCard label="Not a Campaign" color="gold">
    <p>Each game is a standalone session — there are no legacy components, no unlocking boxes across sessions. But <em>knowledge</em> persists. What you learn about the planet helps in future games.</p>
  </SideCard>
</>}>

You and your fellow players are crew members on an intergalactic vessel heading toward an uncharted planet. After a malfunction, you crash-land in different locations — separated, but connected by intercom.

You see the world from a **first-person perspective**. Only you can see your location card. You can describe what you see to other players, but you can't show them.<sup>1</sup>

<RuleBox>
**Vantage is a cooperative, open-world exploration game.** Your group shares a mission. Explore the planet, gain cards, discover resources, and work together — even though you're physically apart in the game world.
</RuleBox>

There are no set paths. You have complete freedom to explore, interact, and discover in whatever order you choose. The planet has nearly 800 interconnected locations and over 900 discoverable cards.<sup>2</sup>

On your turn, you choose **one action** from three types:

<RawHTML html={`<div class="flow">
  <span class="fb fb-blue">Location Action</span>
  <span style="color:var(--text-muted);font-family:var(--font-ui);font-size:12px;">or</span>

  <span style="color:var(--text-muted);font-family:var(--font-ui);font-size:12px;">or</span>
  <span class="fb fb-green">Depart</span>
</div>`} />

### Location Actions

Each location card lists up to 6 actions, one in each skill category: <span className="sk sk-move">Move</span> <span className="sk sk-look">Look</span> <span className="sk sk-engage">Engage</span> <span className="sk sk-help">Help</span> <span className="sk sk-take">Take</span> <span className="sk sk-overpower">Overpower</span>. Choose one, then look up the result in the matching storybook.

<RuleBox danger>
**One location action per visit.** Once you perform any location action at your current location, you cannot perform another location action there — even on a future turn.<sup>1</sup> You must depart or take a card action instead.
</RuleBox>

### Card Actions

Many cards in your grid, supply, or the center have actions printed on them. You can perform these instead of a location action.

### Depart

Move to an adjacent location in one of four cardinal directions (north is always "forward"). Each location shows a compass rose with numbered destinations or stars (\*) that require a Depart storybook lookup.

<RuleBox>
**You choose without knowing the cost or outcome.** You always succeed at your chosen action — the challenge is what it costs you.<sup>2</sup> You may not change your mind after reading the cost.<sup>3</sup>

<StepRow step={3} title="Challenge Dice — The Core Tension" sidebar={<>
  <SideCard label="Like One Deck Dungeon" color="blue">
    <p>If you've played One Deck Dungeon, the challenge dice work similarly — you roll dice against a challenge and place them on available spaces. Unplaced dice mean penalties. Your card collection determines how many dice you can absorb.</p>
  </SideCard>
  <SideCard label="Refreshing Dice" color="gold">
    <p>If there aren't enough dice in the pool when you need to roll, <strong>refresh all dice</strong> — return every challenge die from all player grids and the center penalty section back to the pool. Then roll.</p>
  </SideCard>
</>}>

Every action has a **cost** — a number representing its difficulty. You roll that many black **challenge dice** <span className="die die-challenge">?</span> from the shared pool on the center board.

For example, a cost of 3 means you roll 3 challenge dice. Higher costs mean harder actions with more potential consequences.

### What the Dice Show

Each challenge die has six faces. The possible results are:

<GameTable
  headers={["Face", "Meaning"]}
  rows={[
    ["<strong>Time</strong> ⏱", "Lose 1 time if unplaced — find a matching slot or suffer the penalty"],
    ["<strong>Morale</strong> ❤", "Lose 1 morale if unplaced — find a matching slot or suffer the penalty"],
    ["<strong>Health</strong> 🛡", "Lose 1 health if unplaced — find a matching slot or suffer the penalty"],
    ["<strong>Setback</strong>", "Must be placed on a setback slot — or suffer a penalty"],
    ["<strong>Blank</strong>", "No effect — return to the center. The best result you can roll!"]
  ]}
/>

The dice are generous: roughly half the faces are blanks. But the other faces create the game's tension — you need somewhere to put them, or you lose resources.

    <p>Offering your impact slots proactively is one of the most impactful (pun intended) things you can do. Keep an eye on what slots you have open and communicate them to teammates.</p>
  </SideCard>
</>}>

Cards in your grid have **slots** — spaces where you can place challenge dice to absorb their results. Each slot accepts a specific type of result (a skill color or setback).

When you place a die on a slot, you avoid the penalty AND often gain a bonus — like 1 boost token on that card.

### Impact Slots

Some slots are marked as **impact** slots. These are special: *any player* can place a matching die there, not just the card's owner. This is one of the strongest cooperative tools in the game.

<RuleBox>
**You can only place challenge dice on cards in your grid.** Reserved cards and cards in your supply do not have active slots. Impact slots on any player's grid are available to everyone.

Any challenge die that you *cannot* place on a slot causes a **penalty**. You lose the resource shown on that die:

<RawHTML html={`<div class="flow">
  <span class="fb fb-blue">⏱ Time</span>
  <span class="fb" style="background:var(--sk-engage);color:#fff;">❤ Morale</span>
  <span class="fb fb-red">🛡 Health</span>
</div>`} />

Each player tracks these three resources on the center board, on a scale of 0 to 6. Unplaced dice go to the penalty section of the center board.

<RuleBox danger>
**If any tracker reaches 0, the game can end.** There is a one-time reprieve option presented by the mission card<sup>1</sup> — but after that, hitting 0 means defeat. Watch the shared stats closely: it's often better to help a struggling teammate than to push your own exploration.
</RuleBox>

### Damage

Some locations also cause **damage** (heat, cold, or hypoxia) when you arrive. For each point of damage, you lose either 1 <span className="tr tr-health">🛡 health</span>, or *both* 1 <span className="tr tr-time">⏱ time</span> and 1 <span className="tr tr-morale">❤ morale</span>.

  </SideCard>
  <SideCard label="Skill Economy" color="green">
    <p>Early in the game, skill tokens are your main way to make actions safer. As your grid fills with slots, dice placement becomes more reliable and skill tokens become less critical.</p>
  </SideCard>
</>}>

Before rolling challenge dice, you may spend **skill tokens** to reduce the cost. Each matching skill token spent removes 1 die from the roll.

There are 6 types of skill tokens, one per action category:

<span className="sk sk-move">Move</span> <span className="sk sk-look">Look</span> <span className="sk sk-engage">Engage</span> <span className="sk sk-help">Help</span> <span className="sk sk-take">Take</span> <span className="sk sk-overpower">Overpower</span>

If an action costs 3 <span className="sk sk-look">Look</span> and you spend 1 look skill token, you only roll 2 dice. If you reduce the cost to 0, you don't roll any dice at all — the action is free.

<RuleBox danger>
**Skill tokens are never required to take an action.**<sup>1</sup> You don't need a blue token to move, or a green token to help. Tokens only reduce cost. This is the most common mistake new players make.
</RuleBox>

### Earning Skill Tokens

You gain skill tokens from action results, boost powers on your character, and by rolling skill dice. When the game says "gain a random skill," you roll a skill die and take the matching token.

You can also gain random skills when your <span className="tr tr-time">⏱ time</span>, <span className="tr tr-morale">❤ morale</span>, or <span className="tr tr-health">🛡 health</span> is already at 6 and you would gain more — instead, you gain a random skill token.<sup>2</sup>

<StepRow step={7} title="Your Grid — Building Your Abilities" sidebar={<>
  <SideCard label="Grid = Your Character Sheet" color="gold">
    <p>Think of the grid as your evolving character sheet. Your starting character is generic — the cards you collect define who you become. An animal companion, a crafted weapon, a learned ability. Every game builds a different character.</p>
  </SideCard>
  <SideCard label="Fill It Up" color="green">
    <p>The game gives you a "destiny" reward when you first complete your grid with 8 surrounding cards. Prioritize gaining cards early — it's both mechanically powerful and narratively rewarding.</p>
  </SideCard>
</>}>

Each player builds a **3×3 grid** of cards with their character card at the center. The 8 surrounding spaces are filled with cards you discover through exploration — items, animals, abilities, and more.

<RawHTML html={`<div class="grid-vis">
  <div class="grid-cell gc-empty">?</div>

  <div class="grid-cell gc-empty">?</div>
  <div class="grid-cell gc-filled">Ability</div>
  <div class="grid-cell gc-empty">?</div>
</div>`} />

Every card you add to your grid provides new **slots** for placing dice, **boost powers** to use, and sometimes new **actions** you can take.

### Reserve

If your grid is full and you gain a new card, it goes to your **reserve**. Your character starts with a reserve capacity of 1 (some cards increase this).<sup>1</sup> You can pay 1 boost from your character to swap a reserved card into your grid.

<RuleBox>
**Reserved cards cannot use slots, abilities, or boost powers.** They retain any boost tokens on them, and their challenge dice are refreshed, but they are inactive until placed in your grid.
</RuleBox>

### "When Placed" Benefits

Many cards have a "when placed" benefit — a one-time bonus you gain the first time you place that card into your grid (like gaining 2 boost). This triggers only on the initial placement.<sup>2</sup>

<Footnotes entries={[
  { num: 1, text: 'Official Rulebook, "Reserve": Default reserve capacity is 1. Some cards grant additional reserve capacity.' },

    <p>If a challenge die ability says "place them in the center," it means the <strong>penalty section</strong> of the center board. If it meant the pool, it would say "refresh." This trips people up.</p>
  </SideCard>
</>}>

**Boost** <span className="boost"></span> represents knowledge you've gained through exploration. Boost tokens are small cubes placed on your cards, and you spend them to activate powerful abilities.

### Where Boost Lives

Boost from **location actions and departing** goes on your character card. Boost from all other sources goes on the specific card that generated it.<sup>1</sup> Each card has a limited capacity for boost.

### Boost Powers

Cards in your grid have **boost powers** — abilities you activate by spending boost from that card. For example, your starting character lets you pay 2 <span className="boost"></span> to gain a <span className="sk sk-move">Move</span> skill token, or pay 1 <span className="boost"></span> to reroll a challenge die.

<RuleBox>
**Boost powers can be used at any time — even during another player's turn.**<sup>2</sup> Their effects last until the end of the current turn. If a boost power has an "impact" icon, it can benefit any player.
</RuleBox>

Vantage includes **8 storybooks** that contain over 7,000 action results. When you take an action, another player reads the relevant entry aloud to you.

There's one storybook for each action category (<span className="sk sk-move">Move</span>, <span className="sk sk-look">Look</span>, <span className="sk sk-engage">Engage</span>, <span className="sk sk-help">Help</span>, <span className="sk sk-take">Take</span>, <span className="sk sk-overpower">Overpower</span>), plus a separate **Depart** storybook and the **Book of Secrets** (referenced only when instructed).

### The Discovery Rule

You may **describe** what you see on your location card and what happens in storybook results, but you may not **show** other players your card. This preserves the first-person perspective — they might visit that location later.

<RuleBox>
**In multi-option lists, choose before reading the outcome.** If a storybook says "choose to go to location 259 or 310," you commit to one before seeing what's there. A big part of the game is intuiting, discussing, and learning by trying.

Each player explores a different part of the planet. You cannot see each other's locations. But you are connected by intercom and work together in several ways:

### Sharing Information

You can freely describe what you see at your location — the landscape, creatures, available actions, resources — in your own words. Share what you've learned about the world. What you discover benefits everyone.

### Impact Slots

When any player rolls challenge dice, *all* players can offer their impact slots. If a teammate rolls a <span className="sk sk-help">Help</span> result and you have an unused help impact slot on one of your grid cards, that die can go there. This is the game's primary cooperative mechanism.

### Thematic Consistency

If a player burned a bridge at a location, another player who later visits that same location cannot cross the bridge. The game trusts players to remember their collective actions and maintain thematic consistency.

  <SideCard label="Roguelike Spirit" color="gold">
    <p>Like a roguelike video game, you won't see everything in one session. You're meant to play, explore, lose, learn, and try again. Each playthrough reveals new corners of the world.</p>
  </SideCard>
  <SideCard label="21 Missions" color="green">
    <p>Mission difficulty varies. Missions assigned by rolling doubles on the skill dice are harder. The game recommends rerolling doubles for your first game.</p>
  </SideCard>
</>}>

At the start of each game, the group receives a **mission** — one of 21 possible objectives that represents why you traveled to this planet. Completing the mission is the primary way to "win."

### Destinies

Along the way, you may discover **destiny** cards — personal objectives that represent how you choose to respond to being stranded. Completing your first grid of 8 cards is one way to earn a destiny.

### How the Game Ends

<RawHTML html={`<div class="flow">
  <span class="fb fb-green">Mission Complete → Win!</span>
  <span class="fa">|</span>
  <span class="fb fb-red">Any tracker hits 0 → Danger</span>
</div>`} />

When a tracker first reaches 0, the mission card presents a one-time reprieve option. After that, hitting 0 again means the game ends. The group decides together whether they've accomplished enough to feel satisfied.

<RuleBox>
**Victory is partly self-defined.** The mission is the structured win condition. But many players also set personal goals — exploring a specific region, solving a puzzle, finding a companion. The game explicitly supports intrinsic motivation alongside the mission.

<StepRow step={12} title="Setup" sidebar={<>
  <SideCard label="Setup IS the First Scene" color="gold">
    <p>Vantage's setup is designed to feel like the game has already begun. Reading the Book of Vantages, choosing your character, and crash-landing — it's all part of the narrative. Lean into it.</p>

Now that you understand how the game works, here's how to set it up:

### 1. The Center

Place the game board in the center (either side — they offer the same gameplay, different layout). Place all storybooks, skill tokens, coins, boost tokens (cubes), and skill dice in a shared supply nearby.

### 2. Challenge Dice Pool

Seed the pool with **8 dice + 2 per player**.<sup>1</sup> For a 3-player game, that's 14 dice. Return excess dice to the box.

### 3. Book of Vantages

Place the Book of Vantages face-up showing **location 000**. This starts the game's narrative and guides the rest of setup.

### 4. Follow Location 000

Read the back of the Book of Vantages (sections 1–4). These instructions walk you through:

- Each player chooses a **character** (or rolls a skill die for random selection)
- Take the matching skill token and place 2 boost on your character
- Each player gains a **card holder** for their location card
- Set <span className="tr tr-time">⏱ time</span>, <span className="tr tr-morale">❤ morale</span>, and <span className="tr tr-health">🛡 health</span> trackers — the recommended starting level is **4 ("Daring")**
- The first player rolls 2 skill dice to determine the group's **mission** (reroll doubles for an easier start)
- Each player determines their starting **escape pod** and crash location
