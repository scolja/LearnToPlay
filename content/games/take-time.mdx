Take Time is a **cooperative** card puzzle. You and your teammates work together to solve clock challenges — placing numbered cards around a circular clock divided into **6 segments**.

You plan your strategy together *before* seeing your cards, then play them in **complete silence**.

<RuleBox>
**Your team wins a test when every card is placed and all rules are satisfied.** There are 40 tests across 10 chapters. Each chapter introduces new rules that build on what you've already learned.
</RuleBox>

Every clock enforces three **universal rules**:

1. Each of the 6 segments must have **at least 1 card**
2. Segment totals must be in **ascending order** (or equal) clockwise from the clock hand
3. No segment may total **more than 24** (this limit is waived for the first 3 clocks of Chapter 1)<sup>1</sup>

</>}>

The deck has **24 cards** divided into two suits:

- **12 Solar cards** (numbered 1–12) — warm-colored sun backs
- **12 Lunar cards** (numbered 1–12) — cool-colored moon backs

For each test, shuffle all 24 cards together and deal **12 cards** to the players. The remaining 12 are not used. The number of cards per player depends on player count — covered in the Setup step.<sup>1</sup>

</StepRow>

<StepRow step={3} title="Discussion Phase" sidebar={<>
  <SideCard label="Common Mistake" color="red">
    <p>Players instinctively look at their cards when they're dealt. <strong>Don't!</strong> During Discussion, cards stay face down in front of you. You can only see the backs — which tell you the Sun/Moon split in each player's hand.</p>
  </SideCard>
  <SideCard label="Strategy Tip" color="green">
    <p>Experienced players use the Discussion phase to agree on conventions: "Let's aim for low values in segments 1–2 and pile high values in segments 5–6." The more specific your plan, the better you'll coordinate in silence.</p>
  </SideCard>
</>}>

Each test begins with the **Discussion phase**. Players examine the clock — its segments, any special rules printed on it — and strategize together.

The catch: **you cannot look at your cards.** Cards have been dealt to you, but they sit face down. You can see the backs (Solar or Lunar) of your own cards and everyone else's, but nobody knows any values.

### What You CAN Discuss

- General strategy: "Let's keep segments 1 and 2 low"
- The clock's special rules: "Segment 4 needs exactly 3 cards"
- Card type distribution: "I have 3 Solar and 1 Lunar"
- Where to concentrate values: "Someone should save big cards for segment 6"

### What You CANNOT Do

<RuleBox danger>
**No codes, signals, or secret systems.** You may not devise any way to communicate card values indirectly. Examples of forbidden behavior: "If I scratch my ear, I have an 8" or "I'll place my card at an angle to mean it's high." Only genuine discussion of game strategy is allowed.<sup>1</sup>
</RuleBox>

Once all discussion is finished, the group agrees to move on. Players then **pick up and look at their cards** — and from this moment, all communication ends.

If a player picks up their cards before others have finished discussing, that player may no longer participate in the discussion.<sup>2</sup>

<Footnotes entries={[
  { num: 1, text: 'Official Rulebook, p. 4: "You may not use or devise codes or signals for communicating things that do not relate to game actions."', url: 'https://cdn.svc.asmodee.net/production-libellud/uploads/2025/09/TT_RULES_EN_WEB.pdf' },
  { num: 2, text: 'Official Rulebook, p. 4: "If a player picks up their cards before other players have finished their discussion, that player may no longer participate in the discussion."' }
]} />

</StepRow>

<StepRow step={4} title="Placement Phase" sidebar={<>
  <SideCard label="The Heart of the Game" color="gold">
    <p>This is where Take Time shines. You've made a plan, you've seen your cards, and now you must act in perfect silence. Every card you place is a message to your teammates — <em>if</em> they can read it.</p>
  </SideCard>
  <SideCard label="Common Mistake" color="red">
    <p><strong>No communication means none.</strong> No speaking, no whispering, no gestures, no pointed looks, no sighs. Not even a raised eyebrow. The silence must be absolute. Some groups play music to fill the quiet.</p>
  </SideCard>
</>}>

Players pick up their cards and look at them. **All communication stops.**

Any player may place the first card. After that, play proceeds **clockwise** — each player places one card at a time into any of the 6 segments. Cards are placed **face down** by default.

<FlowDiagram steps={[
  { label: "Pick up cards", variant: "dark" },
  { label: "Silence begins", variant: "red" },
  { label: "Place 1 card each", variant: "gold" },
  { label: "Repeat clockwise", variant: "dark" }
]} />

Continue clockwise until all 12 cards have been played.

### Checking Information

You may look at the face of any card **you** placed to confirm its value. You may also ask which player placed a specific card. You may **not** look at face-down cards placed by other players.<sup>1</sup>

<RuleBox>
**You are placing cards into the clock's 6 segments — not specific positions within a segment.** Multiple cards can go in the same segment. The order cards are placed within a segment does not matter; only the total value matters.<sup>2</sup>
</RuleBox>

<Footnotes entries={[
  { num: 1, text: 'Official Rulebook, p. 6: "At any time during this Phase, you may check or confirm any known information that you may have forgotten. You may not look at facedown cards placed by other players."' },
  { num: 2, text: 'Official Rulebook, p. 6: "The next player selects 1 card from their hand and places it next to the segment of their choice, which may be a segment with 1 or more cards next to it, or one with no cards."' }
]} />

</StepRow>

<StepRow step={5} title="Face-Up Cards" sidebar={<>
  <SideCard label="Strategic Signaling" color="green">
    <p>Playing a card face up communicates its exact value to everyone. Use this for critical placements: "I'm putting my 12 here to anchor the high end." Choosing <em>not</em> to reveal when things are going well is also a signal.</p>
  </SideCard>
  <SideCard label="The Limit is Shared" color="red">
    <p>The face-up limit applies to the <strong>whole group</strong>, not per player. If your Reminder token shows 2 eyes, the group gets 2 face-up cards total — not 2 each. Coordinate wisely during Discussion about who might need them.</p>
  </SideCard>
</>}>

By default, cards go face down. But your team has a limited number of **face-up plays** — cards placed with the number showing.

The **Reminder token** (specific to your player count) shows how many face-up cards the group can use. Look for the eye symbols — each one means one face-up card.

A face-up card is powerful: everyone can see the value, removing uncertainty from that segment. But you have only a few of them, and the decision to play face up **cannot be discussed** — it must be made silently during the Placement phase.<sup>1</sup>

  </SideCard>
</>}>

After all cards are played, it's time to check. Starting with the segment marked by the **clock hand**, reveal each face-down card. Don't rearrange the cards — just flip them.

### Checking the Rules

For each segment, add up all card values. Then verify:

<EvalStrip steps={[
  { num: "1", label: "At least 1 card per segment?" },
  { num: "2", label: "Totals ascending clockwise?" },
  { num: "3", label: "No segment over 24?" },
  { num: "4", label: "Special rules satisfied?" }
]} />

If **every condition** is met — you pass the test. Move to the next clock.

If **any condition** fails — you fail the test. But failure isn't the end.

<RuleBox>
**Equal values between adjacent segments are allowed.** The rule is "equal to or greater than" — two segments can share the same total. Totals must be non-decreasing, not strictly increasing.<sup>1</sup>
</RuleBox>

<Footnotes entries={[
  { num: 1, text: 'Official Rulebook, Resolution: "The value of each segment must be equal to or greater than the previous segment."' }
]} />

</StepRow>

<StepRow step={7} title="Failing & Retrying" sidebar={<>
  <SideCard label="Failure is a Teacher" color="green">
    <p>Expect to fail — especially on later clocks. Most groups need 2–4 attempts per clock. Each failure gives you more information: what went wrong, where the plan broke down, and how to adjust. The conversations after a failed attempt are some of the best moments in the game.</p>
  </SideCard>
  <SideCard label="Too Hard? Skip It." color="gold">
    <p>If a clock is beyond you, place it in the <strong>Sleeve of Regrets</strong> and move on. You can come back to it later. Skipping resets all Bonus tokens back to face down.</p>
  </SideCard>
</>}>

When you fail a test, you gain a small advantage for the next attempt.

### Bonus Tokens

Flip one of the 3 **Bonus tokens** face up. Each face-up Bonus token grants the group **1 additional face-up card** on the retry. This means your second attempt has more information than the first, and your third attempt even more.

<SummaryPanel items={[
  { num: "1", text: "1st failure → flip 1 Bonus token → +1 face-up card on retry" },
  { num: "2", text: "2nd failure → flip 2nd Bonus token → +2 face-up cards on retry" },
  { num: "3", text: "3rd failure → flip 3rd Bonus token → +3 face-up cards on retry" }
]} />

Once you **pass** the test, all Bonus tokens flip back face down for the next clock.

### Retrying

Shuffle all 24 cards, re-deal, and try the same clock again. You bring everything you learned from the failure — just not the extra face-up cards from previous tests.

### The Sleeve of Regrets

If a clock is too difficult, you may skip it. Flip any face-up Bonus tokens back down, place the clock in the **Sleeve of Regrets**, and proceed to the next test. You can return to skipped clocks later.<sup>1</sup>

The 40 tests are organized into **10 chapters**, each containing 4 clocks and a rules sheet. Chapters are stored in sealed sleeves and opened sequentially.

### Progressive Difficulty

Chapter 1 clocks use only the universal rules. As you advance, each chapter introduces **new constraints**:

- A segment that requires exactly a certain number of cards
- A segment that only accepts Solar or Lunar cards
- Maximum or minimum value targets for specific segments
- **Center rules** that apply to all 6 segments on that clock
- The **Clock Hand** (introduced in Chapter 3) designating where ascending order begins

<RuleBox>
**Each chapter's rules sheet explains the new mechanics for that chapter.** Read it before attempting the clocks. The rules are cumulative — later chapters assume you know earlier ones.
</RuleBox>

### After All 40 Tests

Once you've attempted every test (passed or failed), you may open the **Rebirth sleeve**. It contains a Second Hand and 6 tokens that add new variability and challenge — extending the game beyond its initial 40 puzzles.<sup>1</sup>

### Setting Up a Test

1. **Select a clock** from the current chapter sleeve
2. **Read the rules sheet** for the chapter if it's your first clock in this chapter
3. **Place the Reminder token** matching your player count near the clock (return the others to the box)
4. **Place 3 Bonus tokens** face down near the Reminder token
5. **Shuffle** all 24 cards (Solar + Lunar) into a single deck
6. **Deal 12 cards** face down to the players:

<GameTable
  headers={["Players", "Cards Each", "Notes"]}
  rows={[
    ["2", "6 (split 4+2)", "Only pick up the 4-card stack first; pick up the 2-card stack after playing 2 cards each"],
    ["3", "4", "Standard deal"],
    ["4", "3", "Standard deal"]
  ]}
/>

### 2-Player Deal

In a 2-player game, each player's 6 cards are split into **two stacks**: one of 4 cards and one of 2 cards. At the end of the Discussion phase, each player picks up only the **4-card stack**. The 2-card stack remains face down — do not look at it. After both players have placed 2 cards from their hand, pick up the remaining **2-card stack** and add those cards to your hand.<sup>1</sup>

7. If the clock is from **Chapter 3 or later**, place the **Clock Hand** near the clock

<RuleBox>
**Do not look at your cards after dealing.** Cards sit face down in front of you. The Discussion phase comes first — you'll pick them up when it's time for Placement.<sup>2</sup>
