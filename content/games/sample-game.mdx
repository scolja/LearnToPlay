    <p>If you've played <strong>Ticket to Ride</strong> or <strong>Catan</strong>, you'll recognize the core loop: collect resources, then spend them to score points.</p>

You are competing to earn the most **Victory Points (VP)** by the end of the game. Each turn, you spend **Action Points** to collect resources, build structures, or advance on the scoring track.

The game ends when any player reaches **20 VP**. At that point, all players tally their final scores.

<RuleBox>
**The player with the most Victory Points wins.** Reaching 20 VP triggers the end, but other players may score more through bonuses.
</RuleBox>

  <SideCard label="Key Insight" color="gold">
    <p>The order in which you take your actions matters. Always collect resources <em>before</em> building.</p>
  </SideCard>
</>}>

On your turn, you have **3 Action Points** to spend. Each action costs 1 AP unless noted otherwise.

### Collect Resources

Take one resource card from the open market or draw blind from the deck.

### Build Structures

Spend resource cards to place a structure on the board. Each structure is worth VP at game end.

**You cannot save unspent Action Points.** Use them or lose them each turn.
