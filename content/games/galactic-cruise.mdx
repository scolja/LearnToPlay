You are a supervisor at **Galactic Cruise** — the first company to offer extended-stay space vacations. The current CEO is retiring, and one supervisor will take the position.

To clinch the job, you need to **earn the most victory points**. You do this by building shuttle ships, scheduling cruises to exotic destinations, satisfying guests, expanding the company's network, and completing company goals.

<RuleBox>
**Galactic Cruise is a competitive worker-placement game.** Place workers at stations to take actions, build ships, and launch cruises carrying guests to space destinations for points. The player with the most VP at game end becomes the new CEO.

Before diving into rules, let's orient you to the three play surfaces you'll be looking at throughout the game.

### The Main Board

The large central board contains:

- **6 Stations** — arranged around the board, each holding 2 **action tiles** (12 total). These are where you place workers to take actions.
- **Network spaces** — the connections *between* stations where gears are placed to link them together, expanding your action reach.
- **Progress track** — divided into 3 sections ("years") along the top. Cubes are placed here when ships launch or goals are completed. Filling a section triggers scoring; filling all three ends the game.
- **Reputation track** — running along the edge, tracking each player's reputation level (affects scoring, network costs, and emergency resources).
- **Company goal area** — 3 randomized shared objectives that any player can compete to complete.
- **Technology tile spaces** — 8 tiles offering permanent passive bonuses, activated by placing gears below them.

### The Marketing Board

A smaller separate board placed beside the main board. It holds:

- **Cruise tile display** — face-up cruise tiles showing available routes. Each tile depicts a sequence of days (space days and colored destination stops) plus a fuel cost.
- **Guest pool** — colored guest meeples (red, blue, yellow, green) available for advertising onto cruise schedules. The pool is seeded during setup from the destinations shown on face-up cruise tiles.
- **Guest bonus tokens** — special bonuses available when certain guest-related milestones are reached.

### Your Player Board

Each player has a personal dual-layer board with recessed spaces. It contains several distinct zones:

- **Ship docking area** (top) — where your cockpit, segments, and engine tiles are placed. Up to 3 ships. Guests sit between adjacent segment pairs.
- **Break room** (top right) — where your idle workers wait. Workers return here when bumped or recalled, earning a funding bonus.
- **Resource rows** (left) — three rows for **food** (yellow), **oxygen** (blue), and **fuel** (orange). Each row has resource marker positions and **gears**. Moving gears off the board frees up storage space.
- **Day in Space reference** (center, angled) — an iconography section showing how color bonuses work during cruise days in space. This looks dense but the actual rule is straightforward (explained in Step 10).
- **Wings** (right) — spaces uncovered when you complete company goals. Each wing scores VP at game end.
- **Expert worker slots** — spaces for up to 2 hired expert workers.

  </SideCard>
  <SideCard label="Actions Are Never Blocked" color="gold">

On your turn, you choose **one** of three options:

<FlowDiagram steps={[
  { label: "Place Worker + 2 Actions", variant: "gold" },
  { label: "Call a Meeting", variant: "dark" },
  { label: "Launch a Ship", variant: "green" }
]} />

### Option 1: Place a Worker

Send one worker from your **break room** to any of the 6 stations on the main board. Then take **two actions** — either from that station's action tiles or from stations connected to it through your network.

### Option 2: Call a Meeting

Retrieve **all** your workers back to the break room. Each returning worker earns a **funding bonus** (printed on the break room space). Then take **one action** at any station connected to one of your development markers on the main board.<sup>1</sup>

### Option 3: Launch a Ship

If your ship meets all requirements (enough food, oxygen, fuel, guests, and a pilot), you may launch instead of taking a normal action. Launching is covered in detail in Step 9.

<RuleBox>
**You must choose exactly one option each turn.** If you have no workers in the break room, you cannot place a worker — you must call a meeting or launch. Plan your worker deployment carefully.
</RuleBox>

<StepRow step={4} title="Worker Placement & Bumping" sidebar={<>
  <SideCard label="Cannot Bump Yourself" color="red">
    <p>You <strong>cannot</strong> bump your own worker from a station. If your worker is already at the station you want, you must go elsewhere, call a meeting first, or unlock the self-bump upgrade. This is a very common mistake.</p>
  </SideCard>
  <SideCard label="Bumping is a Gift" color="gold">
    <p>Being bumped is actually helpful — you get a funding bonus and your worker returns to the break room, ready to deploy again. Experienced players sometimes <em>want</em> to be bumped.</p>
  </SideCard>
</>}>

The main board has **6 stations**, each formed by 2 randomly assigned **action tiles** (12 tiles total). These tiles are shuffled during setup, so the layout changes every game.

### Placing Your Worker

Choose any station and place your worker there. You then take **two actions** from the action tiles at that station or any stations connected to it through your network (more on the network in Step 6).

### Bumping

If the station already has another player's worker, you **bump** it. Their worker returns to their break room and they receive a **funding bonus** — a small reward printed on the station.

<RuleBox danger>
**You can never bump your own worker.**<sup>1</sup> You can only bump an opponent's. If your worker is already at the only station you want, you'll need to call a meeting or find another path through your network.

When you place a worker and take two actions, those actions can come from the station where your worker sits *or* from any station connected to it through the **network** — a web of links between stations.

### Building the Network

Using the **Develop** action, you pay the cost of the leftmost gear in a resource row on your player board and move it to the main board, placing it **between two stations** to create a link.

<RuleBox>
**Using your own gear connections is free. Using an opponent's costs money.**<sup>1</sup> The cost depends on your position on the reputation track — higher reputation means cheaper access (0-2 money per opponent connection used).
</RuleBox>

### Why the Network Matters

On turn one, you can only take actions at the station where your worker sits. As you build connections, each worker placement grants access to a wider range of actions. By mid-game, a well-connected network lets you take almost any two actions from a single placement.

At game end, each **column** on your player board that has been completely emptied of its gears scores bonus victory points.<sup>2</sup>

### Technology Tiles

Instead of placing a gear into the network, you can move it **below a technology tile** — one of 8 tiles displayed on the main board during setup. Each technology provides a unique **passive bonus** that lasts for the rest of the game.

Technology bonuses vary each game and can include discounts on future actions, extra resources when performing certain actions, additional scoring opportunities, or rule-bending abilities. The 8 available tiles are randomized, so evaluate which technologies complement your strategy.<sup>3</sup>

The trade-off: a gear placed under a technology does **not** create a network connection. You gain a permanent bonus but don't expand your action reach. Both options are valuable — the right choice depends on your game state.

Your player board tracks three **supply resources** in your inventory:

<GameTable
  headers={["Resource", "Icon", "Used For"]}
  rows={[
    ["<strong>Food</strong>", "🍖", "1 per guest + 1 per pilot when launching a cruise"],
    ["<strong>Oxygen</strong>", "💨", "1 per ship segment when launching a cruise"],
    ["<strong>Fuel</strong>", "⛽", "1 per fuel icon on the cruise schedule"]
  ]}
/>

Two additional currencies exist as **tokens** (not tracked on your board):

- **Money** — the universal currency. Used to buy resources, pay for developments, hire expert workers, and use opponent network connections.
- **Ads** — used to advertise guests onto cruises and pay for guests at destinations.

### Getting Resources

Three actions from Step 5 help you stock up:

- **Buy**: Spend 1 money to gain 2 resources of any type or 2 ads from the supply.
- **Silo** (free): Take up to 3 resources if the company silo has any available.
- **Replenish**: Discard an agenda card from your hand to fill one resource type to maximum, gaining 1 money per step moved plus 1 reputation.<sup>1</sup>

<RuleBox>
**Your inventory has limited storage.** Each resource row on your player board has a maximum capacity. Moving gears off your board (to the network or technology) frees up additional storage space — each gear removed opens one more position in that row.
</RuleBox>

Ships are how you score the majority of your points. Building one takes several actions across multiple turns.

### Step A: Get a Cockpit & Engine

Using the **Get New Ship** action, acquire a **cockpit/engine pair** — these are the front and back of your ship. The **engine** gives an immediate bonus when you acquire it. The **cockpit** shows a launch bonus (scored when you launch) and an endgame bonus. You can have up to **3 ships**.<sup>1</sup>

### Step B: Get Blueprints

Using the **Get Blueprints** action, take up to **2 blueprint tiles** from the supply. Each blueprint shows a ship segment you can build. The supply refreshes after you draw. You can pay extra to build a segment immediately when acquiring it.

### Step C: Build Segments

Using the **Build** action, pay the **build cost** shown on a blueprint to construct it as a segment of your ship. Segments are placed between the cockpit and engine. Each two adjacent segments create a space for one guest.

### Ship Segment Color Tags

Each segment has **color tags** (red, blue, yellow, or green). These colors matter during cruise days in space — matching guest colors to your ship's color tags generates bonuses. Choose blueprints whose colors complement your cruise route and guest strategy.

<RuleBox>
**A ship needs a minimum of 2 segments to launch.**<sup>2</sup> The cockpit and engine are required but do not count as segments for guest capacity or oxygen cost.

Getting your ship into space is a multi-step process that spans several turns.

### Reading a Cruise Tile

Each **cruise tile** on the marketing board shows a route your ship will follow. The tile displays:

- A sequence of **days** — each day is either a "day in space" or a colored **destination stop** (red, blue, yellow, or green).
- A **fuel cost** — the number of fuel icons you must pay when launching.
- The **number of destinations** — more stops means more scoring opportunities but more ads needed.

When choosing a cruise, look for routes whose destination colors match the guests and ship segment colors you've been building toward.

### 1. Schedule a Cruise

Using the **Schedule** action, move your **consultant** to an available cruise tile on the marketing board. This commits you to that route. You gain a funding bonus and flip the cruise's token. You can only have one active schedule at a time.<sup>1</sup>

### 2. Advertise Guests

Using the **Advertise** action, pay **ad costs** to move up to 2 **guests** from the marketing board's guest pool to below any cruise schedule. For each guest moved, you earn 1 money per destination on that cruise, plus additional reputation if the guest's color matches a day on the route.

### The Guest Pool

The marketing board's **guest pool** contains colored meeples (red, blue, yellow, green). During setup, the pool is seeded with guests matching the colors of destinations shown on face-up cruise tiles. As guests are advertised onto cruises and new cruise tiles are revealed, the pool shifts. If the pool runs low, additional guests of each color are added.

### 3. Launch

On your turn, instead of placing a worker or calling a meeting, choose to **launch**:

1. **Choose a pilot** — select a worker from your break room. This worker goes to space and is unavailable until the cruise returns.
2. **Add guests** — presold (advertised) guests board automatically. You may also pay ads to add guests directly from the supply.
3. **Pay resources** — 1 food per guest, 1 food per pilot, 1 oxygen per ship segment, 1 fuel per fuel icon on the schedule.
4. **Launch!** — place a progress cube on the track. Score your cockpit's launch bonus.

<RuleBox danger>
**Launching replaces your normal turn action.**<sup>2</sup> You do not place a worker or call a meeting on a launch turn. Your pilot worker leaves Earth and will not return until the cruise is complete.

Once launched, your ship advances **one day** on its cruise route at the start of each of your subsequent turns. Each day is one of three types:

### Day in Space

Your guests enjoy the ship's amenities. Here's how the color bonus works step by step:

1. **Look at your guests** — note each guest's color (red, blue, yellow, green).
2. **Count matching color tags on your ship** — each segment (and some cockpits/engines) shows color tags. Count how many tags match each guest color.
3. **Multiply** — for each color, multiply the number of guests of that color by the number of matching tags. That's how many bonuses of that color type you receive.

**Example**: You have 2 red guests and your ship has 3 red color tags. You receive 2 x 3 = 6 red bonuses. Each color's bonus type is shown on the player board's Day in Space reference section — typically resources, money, ads, or reputation.

### Day at Destination

Your ship arrives at a colored destination stop. Two things happen:

1. **Upgrade tokens** (optional) — you may deliver an **upgrade token** to that destination, choosing one of three available upgrade types. Each upgrade token placed at a destination permanently increases the VP value of that stop for all future guests scored there.
2. **Score guests** — for each guest you want to score, pay ads: **1 ad** if the guest's color matches the destination color, **2 ads** if it doesn't. Each scored guest earns **3 VP** plus 1 VP per upgrade token already at that destination.<sup>1</sup>

### Return to Earth

On the final day, the cruise ends. Guests return to the supply, the cruise tile is discarded, your pilot returns to the break room (gaining a funding bonus), and your ship becomes available for the next cruise.

<RuleBox>
**Guests score at each destination they visit — not just once.**<sup>2</sup> A cruise with 3 destination stops means 3 scoring opportunities per guest. Longer cruises with more guests score dramatically more points.

<StepRow step={11} title="Reputation & Company Goals" sidebar={<>
  <SideCard label="Reputation is Multi-Use" color="gold">
    <p>Reputation does three things: (1) scores VP during intermittent and endgame scoring, (2) reduces the cost of using opponent technology connections, and (3) can be spent as an emergency resource. Deciding when to save vs. spend it is a key strategic tension.</p>

  </SideCard>
</>}>

### The Reputation Track

Your position on the **reputation track** affects multiple systems:

- **Scoring**: Reputation translates directly to VP during intermittent scoring phases and at game end.
- **Network costs**: Higher reputation reduces the money cost of using opponent gear connections (from 2 down to 0 per connection).
- **Emergency resource**: You can spend reputation to gain resources in a pinch — but at the cost of future scoring.<sup>1</sup>

You gain reputation from advertising guests (when colors match), certain actions, and agenda card effects. If you reach the maximum on the track, any further reputation gained converts directly to victory points.<sup>2</sup>

### Company Goals

Three randomized **company goal tiles** are placed during setup. These are shared objectives — any player can complete them. When you meet a goal's requirement, you place one of your **progress cubes** onto the progress track and uncover a "wing" on your player board.

<RuleBox>
**Each time a player completes a goal, the requirement increases for all future completions.**<sup>3</sup> The first player to complete a goal has the easiest time. Goals are a race.

### Agenda Cards

**Agenda cards** are powerful multi-use cards. Using the **Get Agenda Cards** action, take up to 2 from the display, or spend reputation to retrieve a previously discarded card.

Agenda cards can be **played for their effect** (often rule-breaking abilities), or **discarded** to replenish one resource type to maximum (gaining 1 money per step refilled plus 1 reputation).<sup>1</sup>

The agenda display provides increasing bonuses the longer it sits without being refilled. When you take the **Refill Agenda** action, you gain bonuses from empty display slots, discard remaining cards, and refill completely.

### Expert Workers

You start the game with **2 basic workers**. Using the **Hire Expert** action, you can recruit up to **2 expert workers**, each with unique powers that vary every game (drawn from a set of 6 expert worker tiles).

Hiring an expert costs **12 money** minus applicable discounts. Once hired, the expert goes to your break room with a funding bonus and is ready to deploy on your next turn. More workers means fewer turns spent calling meetings to retrieve them.<sup>2</sup>

The **progress track** on the main board is divided into **3 sections** (called "years"). Progress cubes are added whenever a player:

- **Launches a ship** (always adds a cube)
- **Completes a company goal** (adds a cube and uncovers a wing)

### Intermittent Scoring

Each time a section of the progress track fills, **intermittent scoring** occurs. All players score VP based on:

- Their position on the **reputation track**
- The number of **progress cubes** they've placed
- Bonuses from completed company goals

### Triggering the End

When the **third section** fills, the end of the game is triggered.<sup>1</sup> Finish the current round so all players have had equal turns. Then each player gets **one extra turn**. After that, each player gets one additional "continue your cruise" action to advance any active cruise.

### Final Scoring

Add up all remaining VP sources:

<GameTable
  headers={["Source", "Details"]}
  rows={[
    ["<strong>Ship cockpit bonuses</strong>", "Endgame VP printed on each cockpit tile"],
    ["<strong>Emptied columns</strong>", "VP for each player board column cleared of all gears"],
    ["<strong>Leftover resources</strong>", "VP for remaining money, resources, and other items"],
    ["<strong>Unbuilt ship penalty</strong>", "<strong>-5 VP</strong> per acquired cockpit/engine with no built segments"],
    ["<strong>Reputation</strong>", "Final reputation scoring"],
    ["<strong>Wings</strong>", "VP from uncovered wings on your player board"]
  ]}
/>

The player with the most VP becomes the new CEO and wins the game. Ties are broken by money remaining.

Now that you understand all the game's mechanics, here's how to set it up.

### 1. Main Board

Place the main board centrally (introductory side for first games, standard side for experienced players). Place the marketing board nearby.

### 2. Action Tiles

For the **standard side**: shuffle the 12 action tiles and place 2 at each of the 6 stations (random pairings). For the **introductory side**: follow the printed layout.

### 3. Technology & Goals

- Place **8 technology tiles** in their designated spaces on the main board
- Place **3 company goal tiles** (randomized from the set of 6)
- Place **expert worker tiles** (number varies by player count, from a set of 6)

### 4. Supply Tiles & Cards

- Shuffle **blueprint tiles** and create a face-up supply
- Shuffle **cockpit tiles** and **engine tiles** and create separate face-up supplies
- Shuffle **cruise tiles** and place face-up on the marketing board
- Shuffle and lay out the **agenda card** display

### 5. Marketing Board & Guests

Place all **guests** beside the marketing board as a supply. For each destination listed on the face-up cruise tiles, take a matching colored guest from the supply and add it to the guest pool. If fewer than the required number (7/9/11 for 1-2/3/4 players), add 1 guest of each color and repeat as needed.<sup>1</sup>

### 6. Player Setup

Each player takes:

- 1 **player board** (dual-layer with recessed spaces)
- 2 **basic workers** (placed in break room)
- 1 **consultant** piece
- **Starting resources**: food, oxygen, fuel per the setup guide
- **Progress cubes** (3 placed above the company goal tile in matching spaces)
- **Starting money** and **ads** per turn order

### 7. Turn Order Compensation

In **reverse turn order**, each player places 1 development (gear) onto the main board for free in an empty network space. Starting reputation is staggered by turn order (0/1/2/3 in a 4-player game).
