You are a supervisor at **Galactic Cruise** — the first company to offer extended-stay space vacations. The current CEO is retiring, and one supervisor will take the position.

To clinch the job, you need to **earn the most victory points**. You do this by building shuttle ships, scheduling cruises to exotic destinations, satisfying guests, expanding the company's network, and completing company goals.

<RuleBox>
**Galactic Cruise is a competitive worker-placement game.** Place workers at stations to take actions, build ships, and launch cruises carrying guests to space destinations for points. The player with the most VP at game end becomes the new CEO.

  <SideCard label="Most Turns = Option 1" color="green">
    <p>The vast majority of your turns will be placing a worker and taking two actions. Calling a meeting is a necessary "reset" when your workers are all deployed. Launching is the big payoff turn you're building toward.</p>
  </SideCard>
  <SideCard label="Actions Are Never Blocked" color="gold">
    <p>Unlike many worker-placement games, you can <em>always</em> place at any station — even one that's already occupied. The bumping mechanic (explained next step) ensures no action is ever truly locked out.</p>
  </SideCard>
</>}>

On your turn, you choose **one** of three options:

<FlowDiagram steps={[
  { label: "Place Worker + 2 Actions", variant: "gold" },
  { label: "Call a Meeting", variant: "dark" },
  { label: "Launch a Ship", variant: "green" }
]} />

### Option 1: Place a Worker

Send one worker from your **break room** to any of the 6 stations on the main board. Then take **two actions** — either from that station's action tiles or from stations connected to it through your network.

### Option 2: Call a Meeting

Retrieve **all** your workers back to the break room. Each returning worker earns a **funding bonus** (printed on the break room space). Then take **one action** at any station connected to one of your development markers on the main board.<sup>1</sup>

### Option 3: Launch a Ship

If your ship meets all requirements (enough food, oxygen, fuel, guests, and a pilot), you may launch instead of taking a normal action. Launching is covered in detail in Step 7.

<RuleBox>
**You must choose exactly one option each turn.** If you have no workers in the break room, you cannot place a worker — you must call a meeting or launch. Plan your worker deployment carefully.
</RuleBox>

<Footnotes entries={[
  { num: 1, text: 'Official Training Manual, "Call a Meeting": Retrieve all workers to break room, gain funding bonuses, then take one action at a connected station.' }
]} />

</StepRow>

<StepRow step={3} title="Worker Placement & Bumping" sidebar={<>
  <SideCard label="Cannot Bump Yourself" color="red">
    <p>You <strong>cannot</strong> bump your own worker from a station. If your worker is already at the station you want, you must go elsewhere, call a meeting first, or unlock the self-bump upgrade. This is a very common mistake.</p>
  </SideCard>
  <SideCard label="Bumping is a Gift" color="gold">
    <p>Being bumped is actually helpful — you get a funding bonus and your worker returns to the break room, ready to deploy again. Experienced players sometimes <em>want</em> to be bumped.</p>
  </SideCard>
</>}>

The main board has **6 stations**, each formed by 2 randomly assigned **action tiles** (12 tiles total). These tiles are shuffled during setup, so the layout changes every game.

### Placing Your Worker

Choose any station and place your worker there. You then take **two actions** from the action tiles at that station or any stations connected to it through your network (more on the network in Step 4).

### Bumping

If the station already has another player's worker, you **bump** it. Their worker returns to their break room and they receive a **funding bonus** — a small reward printed on the station.

<RuleBox>
**You can never bump your own worker.**<sup>1</sup> You can only bump an opponent's. If your worker is already at the only station you want, you'll need to call a meeting or find another path through your network.

<StepRow step={4} title="The Network — Expanding Your Reach" sidebar={<>
  <SideCard label="Like On Mars" color="blue">
    <p>Paying to use opponents' network connections is similar to Vital Lacerda's <strong>On Mars</strong>, where you use other players' infrastructure at a cost. Building your own network avoids fees and scores endgame points.</p>
  </SideCard>
  <SideCard label="Dual Benefit" color="gold">
    <p>Moving a gear off your player board does two things: it creates a connection on the main board <em>and</em> it expands your resource storage capacity. Each gear removed frees up inventory space.</p>
  </SideCard>
  <SideCard label="Common Mistake: Connection Costs" color="red">
    <p>Using an <strong>opponent's</strong> connection costs money (0–2 depending on your reputation). Your <em>own</em> connections are always free. New players often forget to pay when hopping through opponent links.</p>
  </SideCard>
</>}>

When you place a worker and take two actions, those actions can come from the station where your worker sits *or* from any station connected to it through the **network** — a web of links between stations.

### Building the Network

Your player board has rows of **gears** in three resource categories (food, oxygen, fuel). As an action, you pay the cost of the leftmost gear in a row and move it to the main board, placing it **between two stations** to create a link.

Alternatively, you can move a gear below a **technology tile** instead — giving you a passive bonus for the rest of the game rather than a network connection.

<RuleBox>
**Using your own gear connections is free. Using an opponent's costs money.**<sup>1</sup> The cost depends on your position on the reputation track — higher reputation means cheaper access (0–2 money per opponent connection used).
</RuleBox>

### Why the Network Matters

On turn one, you can only take actions at the station where your worker sits. As you build connections, each worker placement grants access to a wider range of actions. By mid-game, a well-connected network lets you take almost any two actions from a single placement.

At game end, each **column** on your player board that has been completely emptied of its gears scores bonus victory points.<sup>2</sup>

Your player board tracks three **supply resources** in your inventory:

<GameTable
  headers={["Resource", "Icon", "Used For"]}
  rows={[
    ["<strong>Food</strong>", "🍖", "1 per guest + 1 per pilot when launching a cruise"],
    ["<strong>Oxygen</strong>", "💨", "1 per ship segment when launching a cruise"],
    ["<strong>Fuel</strong>", "⛽", "1 per fuel icon on the cruise schedule"]
  ]}
/>

Two additional currencies exist as **tokens** (not tracked on your board):

- **Money** — the universal currency. Used to buy resources, pay for developments, hire expert workers, and use opponent network connections.
- **Ads** — used to advertise guests onto cruises and pay for guests at destinations.

### Getting Resources

Several actions help you stock up:

- **Buy**: Spend 1 money to gain 2 resources of any type or 2 ads from the supply.
- **Silo** (free): Take 3 resources if the company silo has any available.
- **Replenish**: Discard an agenda card to fill one resource type to maximum, gaining 1 money per step moved plus 1 reputation.<sup>1</sup>

<RuleBox>
**Your inventory has limited storage.** Each resource row on your player board has a maximum capacity. Moving gears off your board (to the network or technology) frees up additional storage space.
</RuleBox>

Ships are how you score the majority of your points. Building one takes several actions across multiple turns.

### Step A: Get a Cockpit & Engine

Acquire a **cockpit/engine pair** — these are the front and back of your ship. The **engine** gives an immediate bonus when you acquire it. The **cockpit** shows a launch bonus (scored when you launch) and an endgame bonus. You can have up to **3 ships**.<sup>1</sup>

### Step B: Get Blueprints

Take up to **2 blueprint tiles** from the supply. Each blueprint shows a ship segment you can build. The supply refreshes after you draw. You can pay extra to build a segment immediately when acquiring it.

### Step C: Build Segments

Pay the **build cost** shown on a blueprint to construct it as a segment of your ship. Segments are placed between the cockpit and engine. Each two adjacent segments create a space for one guest.

<RuleBox>
**A ship needs a minimum of 2 segments to launch.**<sup>2</sup> The cockpit and engine are required but do not count as segments for guest capacity or oxygen cost.

</>}>

Getting your ship into space is a multi-step process that spans several turns.

### 1. Schedule a Cruise

As an action, move your **consultant** to an available **cruise tile**. This commits you to that route. You gain a funding bonus and flip the cruise's token. You can only have one active schedule at a time.<sup>1</sup>

### 2. Advertise Guests

As an action, pay **ad costs** to move up to 2 **guests** from the marketing board to below any cruise schedule. For each guest moved, you earn 1 money per destination on that cruise, plus additional reputation if the guest's color matches a day on the route.

### 3. Launch

On your turn, instead of placing a worker or calling a meeting, choose to **launch**:

1. **Choose a pilot** — select a worker from your break room. This worker goes to space and is unavailable until the cruise returns.
2. **Add guests** — presold (advertised) guests board automatically. You may also pay ads to add guests directly from the supply.
3. **Pay resources** — 1 food per guest, 1 food per pilot, 1 oxygen per ship segment, 1 fuel per fuel icon on the schedule.
4. **Launch!** — place a progress cube on the track. Score your cockpit's launch bonus.

<RuleBox>
**Launching replaces your normal turn action.**<sup>2</sup> You do not place a worker or call a meeting on a launch turn. Your pilot worker leaves Earth and will not return until the cruise is complete.

  </SideCard>
</>}>

Once launched, your ship advances **one day** on its cruise route at the start of each of your subsequent turns. Each day is one of three types:

### Day in Space

Your guests enjoy the ship's amenities. For each guest color, count the matching color tags on your ship components. Multiply guests of that color by matching tags — you receive that many bonuses of that color type.

### Day at Destination

Your ship arrives at a colored destination stop. You may optionally deliver an **upgrade token** for one of three available upgrades. Then, for each guest you want to score, pay ads: **1 ad** if the guest's color matches the destination, **2 ads** if it doesn't. Each scored guest earns **3 VP** plus 1 VP per upgrade token already at that destination.<sup>1</sup>

### Return to Earth

On the final day, the cruise ends. Guests return to the supply, the cruise tile is discarded, your pilot returns to the break room (gaining a funding bonus), and your ship becomes available for the next cruise.

<RuleBox>
**Guests score at each destination they visit — not just once.** A cruise with 3 destination stops means 3 scoring opportunities per guest. Longer cruises with more guests score dramatically more points.

### The Reputation Track

Your position on the **reputation track** affects multiple systems:

- **Scoring**: Reputation translates directly to VP during intermittent scoring phases and at game end.
- **Network costs**: Higher reputation reduces the money cost of using opponent gear connections (from 2 down to 0 per connection).
- **Emergency resource**: You can spend reputation to gain resources in a pinch — but at the cost of future scoring.<sup>1</sup>

You gain reputation from advertising guests (when colors match), certain actions, and agenda card effects.

### Company Goals

Three randomized **company goal tiles** are placed during setup. These are shared objectives — any player can complete them. When you meet a goal's requirement, you place one of your **progress cubes** onto the progress track and uncover a "wing" on your player board.

<RuleBox>
**Each time a player completes a goal, the requirement increases for all future completions.**<sup>2</sup> The first player to complete a goal has the easiest time. Goals are a race.

### Agenda Cards

**Agenda cards** are powerful multi-use cards. As an action, take up to 2 from the display, or spend reputation to retrieve a previously discarded card.

Agenda cards can be **played for their effect** (often rule-breaking abilities), or **discarded** to replenish one resource type to maximum (gaining 1 money per step refilled plus 1 reputation).<sup>1</sup>

The agenda display provides increasing bonuses the longer it sits without being refilled. When you take the refill action, you gain bonuses from empty display slots, discard remaining cards, and refill completely.

### Expert Workers

You start the game with **2 basic workers**. You can hire up to **2 expert workers**, each with unique powers that vary every game (drawn from a set of 6 expert worker tiles).

Hiring an expert is an action that costs **12 money** minus applicable discounts. Once hired, the expert goes to your break room with a funding bonus and is ready to deploy on your next turn. More workers means fewer turns spent calling meetings to retrieve them.<sup>2</sup>

### The Progress Track

The **progress track** on the main board is divided into **3 sections** (called "years"). Progress cubes are added whenever a player:

- **Launches a ship** (always adds a cube)
- **Completes a company goal** (adds a cube and uncovers a wing)

### Intermittent Scoring

Each time a section of the progress track fills, **intermittent scoring** occurs. All players score VP based on:

- Their position on the **reputation track**
- The number of **progress cubes** they've placed
- Bonuses from completed company goals

### Triggering the End

When the **third section** fills, the end of the game is triggered.<sup>1</sup> Finish the current round so all players have had equal turns. Then each player gets **one extra turn**. After that, each player gets one additional "continue your cruise" action to advance any active cruise.

### Final Scoring

Add up all remaining VP sources:

<GameTable
  headers={["Source", "Details"]}
  rows={[
    ["<strong>Ship cockpit bonuses</strong>", "Endgame VP printed on each cockpit tile"],
    ["<strong>Emptied columns</strong>", "VP for each player board column cleared of all gears"],
    ["<strong>Leftover resources</strong>", "VP for remaining money, resources, and other items"],
    ["<strong>Unbuilt ship penalty</strong>", "<strong>−5 VP</strong> per acquired cockpit/engine with no built segments"],
    ["<strong>Reputation</strong>", "Final reputation scoring"],
    ["<strong>Wings</strong>", "VP from uncovered wings on your player board"]
  ]}
/>

The player with the most VP becomes the new CEO and wins the game. Ties are broken by money remaining.

  </SideCard>
</>}>

Now that you understand all the game's mechanics, here's how to set it up.

### 1. Main Board

Place the main board centrally (introductory side for first games, standard side for experienced players). Place the marketing board nearby.

### 2. Action Tiles

For the **standard side**: shuffle the 12 action tiles and place 2 at each of the 6 stations (random pairings). For the **introductory side**: follow the printed layout.

### 3. Tiles & Cards

- Shuffle and lay out **technology tiles**, **company goal tiles** (3), and **expert worker tiles** (per player count)
- Shuffle **blueprint tiles** and create a supply
- Shuffle **cockpit tiles**, **engine tiles**, and **cruise tiles** and create separate supplies
- Shuffle and lay out the **agenda card** display

### 4. Marketing Board

Place all **guests** beside the marketing board as a supply. For each destination listed on the face-up cruise tiles, take a matching guest from the supply and set it aside. If fewer than the required number (7/9/11 for 1-2/3/4 players), add 1 guest of each color and repeat as needed.<sup>1</sup>

### 5. Player Setup

Each player takes:

- 1 **player board** (dual-layer with recessed spaces)
- 2 **basic workers** (placed in break room)
- 1 **consultant** piece
- **Starting resources**: food, oxygen, fuel per the setup guide
- **Progress cubes** (3 placed above the company goal tile in matching spaces)
- **Starting money** and **ads** per turn order

### 6. Turn Order Compensation

In **reverse turn order**, each player places 1 development (gear) onto the main board for free in an empty network space. Starting reputation is staggered by turn order (0/1/2/3 in a 4-player game).
