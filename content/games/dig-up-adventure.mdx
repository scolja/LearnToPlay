    <p>If you've played <strong>Skyjo</strong> or the card game <strong>Golf</strong>, you'll feel right at home. Dig Up Adventure uses the same hidden-grid-of-cards concept, but adds adventure cards for more player interaction.</p>

You are an adventurer digging for gems in an ancient mine. Your **mine** is a 3&times;3 grid of nine cards. At the start, eight of these are face-down — you don't know what's buried there.

Your goal is simple: fill all nine slots of your mine with cards that score the most points. When any player reveals all nine of their cards, the game ends and scores are tallied.

<RuleBox>
**You win by having the highest score when the game ends.** Finishing first doesn't guarantee victory — it just triggers the end.

Before learning what to *do* on your turn, you need to understand what you're optimizing for. Every card in your mine scores based on two factors: **color** and **position**.

### Your Favorite Color

At the start of the game, you receive a **Player Card** that assigns you a **favorite color**. Gems matching your favorite color are worth more.

### Position Numbering

Each slot in your mine is numbered 1 through 9. Each **gem card** is also numbered 1–9. When a gem's number matches the slot it's placed in, you score a position bonus.

You may play **0, 1, or 2 cards** from your hand. You can play any combination of gem cards and adventure cards.

### Phase 2: Discard (Optional)

After playing, you may discard any unwanted cards from your hand to the discard pile.

### Phase 3: Draw Back to 3

Refill your hand to **3 cards** from the draw pile. Your hand size is always 3 at the start of your next turn.

<RuleBox>
**Your hand limit is 3 cards.** You always draw back up to 3 at the end of your turn, regardless of how many you played or discarded.

Gem cards are the foundation of your mine. When you play a gem card from your hand, you place it into a slot in your mine. The result depends on whether the target slot is face-down or face-up.

### Onto a Face-Down Slot

When you play a gem onto a **face-down card**, the two cards **swap**. Your gem goes into the mine (face-up), and the face-down card comes into your hand — now revealed to you.

<FlowDiagram steps={[

  { label: "Swap", variant: "dark" },
  { label: "Old card to hand", variant: "teal" }

### Onto a Face-Up Slot

When you play a gem onto a slot that already has a **face-up card**, you replace it. The old card goes to the **discard pile** (not your hand).

<FlowDiagram steps={[
  { label: "Gem from hand", variant: "gold" },
  { label: "Replace", variant: "dark" },
  { label: "Old card to discard", variant: "red" }
]} />

<RuleBox danger>
**You cannot peek at your own face-down cards.** The only way to see what's hidden in your mine is to swap a gem into that slot, or use an adventure card that lets you peek or reveal.

    <p>Adventure cards serve a similar role to <strong>action cards in Uno</strong> — they let you mess with opponents or give yourself an advantage beyond just playing gems.</p>

    <p>Peek cards are underrated. Knowing what's face-down in your mine lets you make smarter swaps later. Information is power!</p>

**Adventure cards** are action cards with special effects. When you play one, you apply its effect immediately, then discard it. Adventure cards never go into your mine — they're single-use tools.

### What Adventure Cards Do

Adventure cards let you manipulate the game state in ways gem cards can't. Their effects fall into five categories:

<GameTable
  headers={["Action", "Effect"]}
  rows={[
    ["<strong>Reveal</strong>", "Flip a face-down card in any player's mine face-up"],
    ["<strong>Peek</strong>", "Secretly look at a face-down card (yours or an opponent's) without revealing it to others"],
    ["<strong>Swap</strong>", "Exchange cards between mines — yours or between opponents"],
    ["<strong>Steal</strong>", "Take a card from an opponent's mine and replace it with one from yours"],
    ["<strong>Draw</strong>", "Draw extra cards from the draw pile"]
  ]}
/>

Each adventure card describes its specific effect. Read the card text carefully when you play it.

<RuleBox>
**Adventure cards are discarded after use.** They never occupy a mine slot. Play them for their effect, then put them in the discard pile.
</RuleBox>

<Footnotes entries={[
  { num: 1, text: "BGA News: \"Use Adventure cards to your advantage to reveal, swap or steal cards in play.\" https://en.boardgamearena.com/news?id=712" },
  { num: 2, text: "1jour-1jeu: \"Action cards help you progress or even trouble your adversaries, and are discarded immediately.\" https://en.1jour-1jeu.com/cardgame/2022-dig-up-adventure" }

</StepRow>

<StepRow step={6} title="Idols & Skeletons" sidebar={<>
  <SideCard label="Common Mistake" color="red">
    <p>Players sometimes think you can never have more than one idol. You can — just not from your hand. Swaps and steals can land extra idols in your mine, and that's perfectly legal.</p>

  </SideCard>
</>}>

Two special card types can appear in your mine alongside gems.

### Idol Cards <span className="gem gem-idol">&#9733;</span>

**Idols** are golden treasures worth **2 points** in any position. They ignore the position-numbering system — an idol scores 2 points no matter where it sits.

You may play an idol from your hand into your mine, but only if you **don't already have one** in your mine. However, adventure card effects (like swaps or steals) can result in multiple idols in your mine.

### Skeleton Cards <span className="gem gem-skeleton">&#9760;</span>

**Skeletons** are duds worth **0 points**. They occupy a mine slot without contributing to your score. If one turns up in your mine, try to replace it as soon as possible.

<RuleBox danger>
**You can only play 1 idol from your hand into your mine.** If your mine already contains an idol (even one placed by a card effect), you cannot play another from your hand. Multiple idols only happen through adventure card effects.
</RuleBox>

<Footnotes entries={[
  { num: 1, text: "BGA Rules: \"Idol cards = 2 points.\" and \"You can't play an idol card from your hand if there is already one in your mine.\" https://en.boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=digupadventure" },

The game ends the moment **any player has all 9 cards in their mine face-up**. This can happen through gem swaps, adventure card reveals, or any combination.

Once triggered, all players flip their remaining face-down cards and calculate their scores.

### Tiebreaker

If two or more players tie on points, the player with the **most consecutive cards of their favorite color** in their mine wins. Count adjacent slots (reading left-to-right, top-to-bottom) that contain your color.

<RuleBox>
**When any mine is fully revealed, the game ends immediately.** Every remaining face-down card in all mines is flipped and scores are tallied. You don't get extra turns.

  <SideCard label="Key Insight" color="gold">
    <p>Notice that setup comes <em>after</em> understanding the rules. By now, you know that position 5 is the center and why seeing that card matters — it's your first piece of information about your mine.</p>
  </SideCard>
  <SideCard label="Speed Tip" color="green">
    <p>Deal 9 cards to each player in a row, then let each person arrange their own grid. It's faster than dealing one card at a time into a grid formation.</p>
  </SideCard>
</>}>

Now that you understand how the game works, setup is straightforward.

1. Give each player a **Player Card** that shows their **favorite color**. Keep it visible.
2. Shuffle all **Gem Cards** into one deck and all **Adventure Cards** into a separate deck. Place both as face-down draw piles in the center.
3. Deal **9 cards** face-down from the Gem deck to each player.
4. Each player arranges their 9 cards into a **3&times;3 grid** — this is their **Mine**. All cards stay face-down.
5. Each player **flips their center card** (position 5) face-up.
6. Each player draws **3 cards** to form their starting hand.
7. Choose a starting player. Play clockwise.
