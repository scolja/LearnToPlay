## Rules Summary

### Goal
Cooperatively guide Frodo to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Complete 3 randomly selected objectives before the final objective (Destroy the One Ring). Win by successfully completing the Ring destruction.

### Setup (First Game)
1. Place the game board; set up the Barad-dûr dice tower
2. Place Shadow Strongholds and Havens on marked locations
3. Place initial Shadow Troops on the board per setup instructions
4. Place 4 Nazgûl in Mordor, 5 spread across Middle-earth
5. Place Eye of Sauron token at starting location
6. Set Hope Marker to starting position on Hope Track
7. Set Threat Rate Marker on the Threat Rate Track
8. Shuffle Shadow Cards; place special Isengard and Mordor cards in shadow discard pile
9. Shuffle Player Cards; seed Skies Darken cards into the player deck
10. Each player draws a starting hand (7-card hand limit)
11. Each player receives 2 random character cards and matching figures
12. Place characters at their thematic starting locations (Frodo & Sam in The Shire, Arwen at Rivendell, Faramir at Minas Tirith, etc.)
13. Draw 3 random Objective Cards + the fixed "Destroy the One Ring" card

### Turn Structure

Each player's turn has 3 phases:

#### Phase 1: Perform Actions (up to 5 total)
Divide actions between your 2 characters: one gets up to 4 actions, the other gets up to 1. Must complete all actions with one character before starting the other.

**Available Actions:**

1. **Travel** — Move your character along a path to an adjacent location. When Frodo travels, he must spend a Stealth card/token OR trigger a Search (rolling search dice). Number of search dice = number of Nazgûl in Frodo's region.

2. **Attack** — Roll battle dice to fight Shadow Troops in your region.
   - Red die faces = eliminate enemy troops
   - White die faces = lose friendly troops (unless in a haven)
   - Attacking draws the Eye of Sauron to your region (strategic: redirects attention from Frodo)
   - Characters can spend Resistance tokens to reroll dice

3. **Muster** — Discard a Friendship card to place allied troops (Gondor, Elven, Rohirrim, or Dwarven) from supply onto the board. Four characters can muster without spending Friendship cards.

4. **Prepare** — When at a Haven, discard a card to gain a matching Symbol Token (Friendship, Valor, Stealth, or Resistance). No limit on tokens held.

5. **Capture** — Convert a Shadow Stronghold into a Haven. Requires Valor cards/tokens. Gain 2 Hope when successful.

6. **Fellowship** — Exchange cards with another player whose character is in the same location. Card given must match the current region.

7. **Special Actions** — Some characters and objective cards grant unique actions.

#### Phase 2: Draw Player Cards
Draw the top 2 cards from the Player Deck. If the deck runs out, lose 1 Hope for each card you cannot draw.

**Skies Darken cards** — When drawn, resolve immediately:
- Increase the Threat Rate
- If the Eye of Sauron is in Frodo's region when Skies Darken triggers, lose 2 Hope
- Then reshuffle the shadow discard pile and add it back (like Epidemic cards in Pandemic)

**Event cards** — Positive events that help the Fellowship (14 total in the deck)

**Ring cards** — Special cards Frodo needs to collect; must have 5 Ring symbols to attempt the final objective

#### Phase 3: Shadow Phase
Flip Shadow Cards equal to the current Threat Rate.

Each Shadow Card has two actions:
- **Reinforce** — Place new Shadow Troops at strongholds
- **Advance** — Move existing Shadow Troop groups along colored paths toward Havens

The *back* of the next card on the deck determines which action triggers (Reinforce or Advance). This creates partially predictable but not fully knowable enemy behavior.

**Special Shadow Cards:**
- Drums of War / Wheels of Saruman — Follow card-specific instructions instead of normal reinforce/advance
- Nazgûl movement cards — Move Nazgûl toward Frodo

### Nazgûl Mechanics
- 9 Nazgûl miniatures actively hunt Frodo
- Nazgûl presence in Frodo's region increases search dice count
- The Eye of Sauron attracts Nazgûl to its location
- Éowyn has a unique ability to fight Nazgûl

### Eye of Sauron
- Moves toward regions where players Attack (strategic: attack to draw Eye away from Frodo)
- When Eye is in Frodo's region during Skies Darken, lose 2 Hope
- Frodo should avoid being in the same region as the Eye

### Hope Track
- Central resource tracking fellowship morale
- Starts at a set value; game lost immediately if it reaches 0
- **Lose Hope:** Search failures (each despair result = -1), losing a Haven (-2), unable to draw player cards, Skies Darken with Eye on Frodo (-2)
- **Gain Hope:** Capture a Shadow Stronghold (+2), complete objectives, some character abilities

### Search Mechanic
Triggered when Frodo travels without spending Stealth resources:
- Roll search dice equal to the number of Nazgûl in Frodo's region
- Each "despair" (evil tree) result = lose 1 Hope
- Players can spend Resistance tokens to reroll search dice
- Lower Hope = more dangerous (final Mount Doom roll is harder at low Hope)

### Winning
1. Complete all 3 randomly selected Objective Cards
2. Move Frodo & Sam to Mount Doom
3. Frodo must have 5 Ring symbols (cards + tokens)
4. Roll the final destruction dice — lower Hope makes this harder

### Losing
The Fellowship loses if ANY of these occur:
- **Hope reaches 0** (Frodo succumbs to despair)
- **Cannot place Shadow Troops** when required (supply exhausted)
- **Player Deck depleted** and cannot draw required cards

### Difficulty Levels
- **Intro** — Fewer Skies Darken cards, recommended characters
- **Standard** — Normal Skies Darken count
- **Advanced** — More Skies Darken cards (physical game only)

## Card Suits & Their Uses

| Suit | Color | Primary Use |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Friendship** | Green? | Muster troops |
| **Valor** | Red/Orange? | Capture strongholds |
| **Stealth** | Green/Dark | Frodo movement (avoid search) |
| **Resistance** | Blue? | Reroll dice (combat & search) |
| **Ring** | Yellow/Gold | Required for final objective (need 5) |

---

## Objectives (24 total, 3 random + 1 fixed per game)

Known objective cards:
- **Attain the Blessing of the Elves** — Place 3 Elven troops on the card; troops can't be used elsewhere. Complete when requirements met at Rivendell.
- **Saruman, Your Staff Is Broken** — Capture Isengard-related objective
- **Challenging Sauron** — Confront Sauron's forces
- **Destroy the One Ring** (FIXED, always last) — Frodo at Mount Doom with 5 Ring symbols, final dice roll

Objectives vary significantly in difficulty. Community notes some are much harder than others.

## Errata & FAQ

### Known Rules Confusion Areas

1. **Search dice and Eye of Sauron interaction** — Confusion about whether you roll search dice when the Eye is NOT in Frodo's region but Nazgûl are present. Answer: Search is triggered by Frodo moving without Stealth, and dice count = Nazgûl present (Eye position is separate from Search triggers).

2. **Skies Darken vs Events confusion** — In at least one documented play, players shuffled Event cards instead of Skies Darken cards into the player deck. These are different card types.

3. **Solo mode token sharing** — The rulebook doesn't explicitly state whether characters can share tokens in solo mode (they can). Solo mode has all 5 characters sharing one 7-card hand.

4. **Rulebook Search explanation** — The rulebook's explanation of the Search mechanism regarding Nazgûl counting is noted as confusing; the player reference cards explain it more clearly.

5. **Fellowship action region matching** — Cards given via Fellowship must match the current region.

### No official published errata found as of research date.

## Common Mistakes (ranked by frequency)

1. **Forgetting to pay Stealth when Frodo moves** — Frodo must spend a Stealth card/token each time he travels through dangerous territory, or trigger a Search. New players often forget this cost. — Multiple reviews mention this.

2. **Shuffling wrong cards into player deck** — Mixing up Skies Darken cards with Event cards during setup. — BGG forum reports

3. **Not understanding the Shadow Card dual-action system** — Each shadow card has reinforce AND advance, but which triggers depends on the NEXT card's back. New players may resolve both actions or pick the wrong one. — Reviews note this is confusing initially.

4. **Ignoring the Eye of Sauron's strategic value** — New players focus purely on killing Shadow Troops when attacking, missing that the real value is redirecting the Eye away from Frodo. — Strategy tips emphasize this.

5. **Underusing the Prepare action** — Converting cards to tokens (unlimited storage) at Havens is crucial for long-term resource management. New players hoard cards instead. — Strategy discussions.

6. **Forgetting that ally troops cannot move independently** — Troops require a character to lead them; they don't move on their own. — Multiple teaching guides note this.

7. **Playing solo with official rules instead of two-handed** — The official solo mode (1 hand of 7 cards, all 5 characters) is considered significantly harder and less fun than two-handed solo. — BGG solo strategies thread, coopgestalt review.

8. **Not tracking Hope losses carefully** — Multiple Hope-loss triggers can cascade quickly. Players lost in as few as 3 turns when not tracking carefully. — coopgestalt review.

## Teaching Order Recommendations

### Recommended Teaching Order (from community & how-to-play videos)

1. **Theme & Goal** — "You're the Fellowship. Guide Frodo to Mount Doom to destroy the Ring. Complete 3 objectives along the way."

2. **The Board** — Show Middle-earth map, point out regions, paths, Havens (friendly), Strongholds (enemy), Mount Doom destination.

3. **Characters** — Each player controls 2 characters (4 actions + 1 action split). Show unique abilities briefly.

4. **Card Suits** — Explain the 4 resource types (Friendship, Valor, Stealth, Resistance) + Ring cards. Hand limit of 7.

5. **Actions** — Walk through the 6 core actions: Travel, Attack, Muster, Prepare, Capture, Fellowship. Focus on Travel and Attack first as they're most immediately intuitive.

6. **Frodo's Special Movement** — Frodo must spend Stealth or trigger Search. This is THE core tension of the game.

7. **Shadow Phase** — Show how shadow cards work (reinforce vs advance). Explain troop paths on the board.

8. **Hope Track** — Explain what costs Hope and what gains Hope. "If Hope hits 0, you lose immediately."

9. **Eye of Sauron** — Explain how attacking draws the Eye away from Frodo (key strategy).

10. **Objectives** — Read through the 3 selected objectives. Save the final Ring destruction for later.

11. **Play a Round** — Let players take their first turns. Explain Skies Darken cards when they appear naturally.

### Teaching Tips

- **Pandemic comparison is helpful**: "If you know Pandemic, this is Pandemic but with 2 characters each, dice combat, and Frodo's stealth journey replacing the cure mechanic."
- **Don't explain Search dice math upfront** — Wait until Frodo actually needs to move, then explain it in context.
- **The player reference cards are better than the rulebook** for explaining Search and Combat. Hand them out early.
- **Start on Intro difficulty** — Fewer Skies Darken cards makes the learning curve much more forgiving.
- **Emphasize the Eye strategy early** — "Attack not to win battles, but to pull the Eye away from Frodo" is the #1 strategic insight that transforms the game.
- **Teaching takes about 15-20 minutes**, then rules click after 2-3 rounds of play.

## Game Analogies

- **Pandemic** — Same designer, same system. Shadow Cards = Infection Cards. Skies Darken = Epidemic. Shadow Troops spreading = disease cubes spreading. But FotF adds dice combat, 2-character-per-player split, and Frodo's stealth journey.
- **Pandemic: Fall of Rome** — Closest Pandemic variant. Barbarian troops march along paths toward Rome; dice combat. FotF refines and expands this system.
- **Spirit Island** — Similar "cooperative defense of territory against invaders" feel, but FotF is lighter and more thematic.
- **Lord of the Rings (Reiner Knizia, 2000)** — Previous cooperative LotR game with a corruption/despair track. FotF's Hope track is a spiritual successor.
- **Shadows over Camelot** — Cooperative defense game with multiple fronts to manage simultaneously.

## Confusing Areas (from reviews)

| Area | What's Confusing | Source |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| Shadow Card resolution | Which action triggers (reinforce vs advance) depends on the NEXT card | Multiple reviews |
| Search dice counting | How many dice to roll based on Nazgûl presence | Wargamer review, BGG forum |
| Board clutter | At 4-5 players, the board becomes crowded with troops and tokens | GamesRadar review |
| Pacing | Occasional turns where a player has limited useful options | GamesRadar review |
| Solo mode | Official solo rules feel restrictive; 2-handed solo is community-preferred | coopgestalt review |
| Action split | 4+1 vs sometimes desired 3+2 or 2+3 split between characters | gamesnightguru (notes 4+1 or 3+2) |

## Designer Insights (from Design Diary)

Key design decisions that inform teaching:

1. **Hope/Despair is THE central resource** — Originally separate loss conditions (haven capture, deck exhaustion, corruption) were unified into a single Hope track. Teaching should emphasize this as the primary thing to manage.

2. **The two-character split prevents "clumping"** — Players controlling 2 characters across different regions solves the alpha-player and group-bunching problems. Teach this as a feature, not a limitation.

3. **"When in doubt, drop the restriction"** — Designer philosophy. The game intentionally has fewer fiddly restrictions than expected. No stacking limits on friendly troops, no individual location effects.

4. **Eye of Sauron movement from combat is intentional design** — Attacking is as much about redirecting Sauron's gaze as killing troops. This should be taught as THE core strategy.

5. **Objectives replaced ring collection as pacing mechanism** — Objectives provide narrative structure and incremental goals. They're the heartbeat of the game, not just checkboxes.
