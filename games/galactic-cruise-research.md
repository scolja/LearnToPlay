## Rules Summary

### Theme & Goal
Players are supervisors at Galactic Cruise, the first company to offer extended-stay space vacations. The CEO is retiring and one supervisor will take the position. Earn the most victory points by building shuttles, scheduling cruises, satisfying guests, enhancing the company network, inventing technologies, and growing the workforce.

### Turn Structure
On your turn, choose ONE of three options:

1. **Place a Worker + Take Two Actions**: Send a worker to one of six stations. Take two actions from that station or connected stations (via your gear/technology network). If the station has an opponent's worker, you bump them — giving them a funding bonus.

2. **Call a Meeting**: Retrieve all your workers to the break room (each gains a funding bonus). Then perform one action at any station connected to one of your development markers.

3. **Launch a Ship**: If your ship meets all requirements (enough food per guest/pilot, oxygen per segment, fuel per schedule), launch instead of placing a worker. Adds a cube to the progress track.

### Phase Structure Per Turn
1. **Advance on Cruise** (if applicable): If you have a ship in space, move forward one day.
   - **Day in Space**: Multiply colored guests × matching color tags on ship components for bonuses.
   - **Day at Destination**: Optionally deliver upgrade tokens. Pay ads per guest (1 if color matches, 2 if not). Each scored guest earns 3 points + 1 per upgrade token at that destination.
   - **Return to Earth**: Guests return to supply, cruise discarded, pilot returns to break room (gains funding bonus), ship available again.

2. **Main Action**: Choose one of the three options above.

3. **Check Achievements**: If criteria met, move a cube to the progress track and uncover a "wing."

### Action Spaces & Stations
12 Action Tiles randomly placed (2 per station), creating 6 locations. Actions include:
- Get resources/ads (buy, silo, or replenish via agenda cards)
- Build a ship (get cockpit/engine, get blueprints, build segments)
- Schedule a cruise / Advertise to guests
- Buy developments (gears) for network or technology
- Hire expert workers
- Get agenda cards / Refill agenda display

### Bumping Mechanic
Action spaces are never blocked. Placing on an occupied space bumps the opponent's worker back, giving them a funding bonus. You cannot bump your own worker (unless upgraded).

### Network / Developments
Pay the cost of the leftmost gear in a resource row. Move the gear either:
- To the network (connecting two stations, expanding action combinations)
- Below a technology (gaining a passive bonus for the game)
At end of game, each column emptied of gears scores points. Using your own connections is free; using opponents' costs 0–2 money depending on your reputation level.

### Ship Building
- Get a cockpit/engine set (max 3 ships per player). Engine = immediate bonus; cockpit = launch + endgame bonus.
- Get blueprints from supply (up to 2; pay extra to build immediately).
- Build segments by paying build cost. Two adjacent segments hold one guest. Minimum 2 segments to launch.
- Lose 5 points for unbuilt ships at game end.

### Cruise Scheduling & Advertising
- **Schedule**: Move your consultant to a cruise tile (one active schedule only, cannot relocate). Gain funding bonus and flip token.
- **Advertise**: Pay ad cost to move up to 2 guests under any cruise schedule. Earn 1 money per destination + reputation if guest color matches a day.

### Launching
1. Choose pilot (worker from break room)
2. Add guests: Presold (advertised) guests go below schedule; pay ads for additional from supply. Presold guests not taken cost 2 reputation.
3. Pay resources: food (per guest/pilot), oxygen (per segment), fuel (per schedule).
4. Start cruise: Place cube on progress track, trigger cockpit scoring.

### Resources
- **Food, Oxygen, Fuel**: Tracked on player board inventory. Used to supply cruises.
- **Money**: Tokens. Used to buy resources, pay for developments, hire experts, use opponent connections.
- **Ads**: Tokens. Used to advertise guests onto cruises and pay ad costs at destinations.
- **Reputation**: Track on main board. Scores VP during intermittent scoring, reduces cost of using opponent tech, can be spent for emergency resources.

### Expert Workers
Start with 2 basic workers. Can hire 2 expert workers with unique per-game powers. Left expert costs 12 minus 3 per black upgrade used; right expert costs 12 minus 2 per food/oxygen gear moved.

### Agenda Cards
Multi-use cards with powerful rule-breaking effects. Get up to 2 from display, or spend reputation for a previously discarded card. Can be discarded for resource replenishment.

### Progress Track & Game End
Cubes added when players complete company goals or launch ships. Three sections ("years"). When each section fills, intermittent scoring occurs (reputation + goals). When all three sections fill, finish the round for equal turns, then all players get one extra turn plus one "continue your cruise" action. Final scoring includes ships, leftover items, column bonuses, etc.

### Scoring Sources
- Cruise destinations (3 VP per scored guest + upgrades)
- Ship cockpit bonuses (launch + endgame)
- Company goals (cubes on progress track)
- Reputation track (intermittent scoring)
- Player board columns emptied of gears
- Ship endgame scoring
- Leftover resources/items
- -5 VP per unbuilt ship

## Errata & FAQ
- Official FAQ living document on BGG: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3442520/galactic-cruise-faq-living-document
- Community FAQ wiki: https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/GalacticCruise_FAQ
- Easily overlooked rules thread: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3509177/easily-overlooked-rules-and-other-clarifications
- Publisher rules page: https://www.kinsonkeygames.com/rules-questions

Key clarifications:
- You CANNOT bump your own worker unless you've unlocked that upgrade
- Scheduling a cruise is a separate action from launching; consultant cannot be relocated once placed
- Funding bonus tokens flip when used during scheduling
- You can advertise any cruise you can pay for, not just ones you've scheduled
- BGA-specific: Bumped worker funding bonuses resolve before your next turn, not during opponent's turn
- Presold guests you don't take during launch cost 2 reputation each
- Reputation overflow at track maximum converts to VP

## Common Mistakes (ranked by frequency)
1. **Bumping own workers** — Players try to bump their own workers for funding bonuses. Not allowed without upgrade. Source: BGG Easily Overlooked Rules thread
2. **Day in Space confusion** — The player board section showing "day in space" rules is packed with iconography and feels overwhelming. Players misread the bonus multiplication. Source: BoardGameShots review, Punchboard review
3. **Forgetting presold guest penalty** — Advertised guests you don't load on launch cost 2 reputation each. Source: BGA rules help
4. **Network connection costs** — Forgetting that using opponent connections costs money (0-2 based on reputation). Source: multiple reviews
5. **One cruise schedule at a time** — Players try to schedule multiple cruises. You can only have one active schedule. Source: BGA rules help
6. **Ship segment guest capacity** — Each TWO adjacent segments hold ONE guest. A 3-segment ship holds 2 guests, not 3. Source: rulebook
7. **Unbuilt ship penalty** — Lose 5 points per unbuilt ship (cockpit/engine acquired but no segments). Source: BGA rules help

## Teaching Order Recommendations
From community teaching guides and video tutorials:
1. Start with the theme: you're competing to become CEO of a space cruise company
2. Explain the three turn options (place worker, call meeting, launch) at a high level
3. Teach worker placement + bumping mechanic
4. Explain the network/gear system and how it expands action access
5. Teach ship building (blueprints → segments → cockpit/engine)
6. Teach cruise scheduling and advertising guests
7. Teach launching requirements (resources needed)
8. Explain the cruise journey (days in space, destinations, return)
9. Teach scoring (progress track, intermittent scoring, endgame)
10. Setup last

The introductory game setup (one side of the main board) uses symbiotic action pairs that ease players in before randomized standard setup.

## Game Analogies
- **Worker bumping** is like The Gallerist (Lacerda) — spaces never block, bumping rewards the displaced player
- **Building ship segments from blueprints** is like Kanban EV / Vinhos — constructing from plans
- **Paying to use opponents' technology connections** is like On Mars (Lacerda) — using other players' infrastructure at a cost
- **Resource management for launching** is like a simplified Terraforming Mars production chain
- **Agenda cards** are like the multi-use cards in Ark Nova — can be played for effects or discarded for resources
- **Progress track scoring** is similar to intermittent scoring in Great Western Trail
- **Overall weight and feel** — frequently compared to Vital Lacerda games but more forgiving

## Confusing Areas (from reviews)
- "Day in Space" section on player board — too much iconography crammed in a slanted section. Source: BoardGameShots review
- Ship segment capacity (2 segments = 1 guest) — unintuitive at first. Source: multiple BGG threads
- Difference between scheduling and launching — separate actions often confused. Source: BGG FAQ
- Network connection costs varying by reputation level. Source: reviews
- When to use intro vs standard setup. Source: reviews
