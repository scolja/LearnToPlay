## Rules Summary

### Objective
Fill the 9 slots of your mine (3×3 grid) with cards that grant the most points. The player with the highest score when the game ends wins.

### Setup
1. Separate Adventure cards (brown backs) from Gem cards.
2. Each player takes a **Player Card** that indicates their **favorite color** (one of the gem colors).
3. Shuffle the Gem card deck. Deal 9 cards face-down to each player. Each player arranges them in a 3×3 grid — this is their **Mine**.
4. Each player flips their **center card** (position 5) face-up.
5. Shuffle Adventure cards into their own draw pile.
6. Each player draws 3 cards to form their starting hand (mix of gem and adventure cards from both piles — exact draw source TBD, likely a shared draw from the combined deck or separate piles).
7. A common draw pile and discard pile are placed centrally.

### Mine Layout (Position Numbering)
```
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
```
Position 5 (center) is revealed at start. All others begin face-down.

### Turn Structure — Three Phases
1. **Play up to 2 cards** from your hand:
   - **Play a Gem Card:** Swap it with a face-down card in your mine (the mine card goes to your hand, revealed). OR place it over a face-up card in your mine (the replaced card goes to discard).
   - **Play an Adventure Card:** Apply its effect immediately, then discard it.
   - **Play an Idol Card:** Place it in your mine (max 1 idol per mine from hand — but card effects can add more).
2. **Discard** (optional): Discard any unwanted cards from your hand.
3. **Draw back to 3 cards:** Refill your hand to 3.

### Card Types

**Gem Cards (54 total)**
- Numbered 1–9, in multiple colors.
- Score based on color matching and position matching.

**Adventure Cards (42 total)**
- Action cards that let you: **reveal** face-down cards (yours or opponents'), **swap** cards between mines, **steal** cards from opponents, **spy/peek** at face-down cards, and **draw** extra cards.
- Discarded after use.

**Idol Cards**
- Special cards worth 2 points each.
- Can be placed in any mine slot.
- Max 1 can be played from hand, but card effects may result in more.

**Skeleton Cards (4 total)**
- Worth 0 points.
- Bad cards that take up mine slots with no value.
- Can end up in your mine through card swaps or bad luck.

### Scoring System
| Condition | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Favorite color gem in correct numbered position | 3 |
| Favorite color gem in wrong position | 2 |
| Non-favorite color gem in correct position | 1 |
| Non-favorite color gem in wrong position | 0 |
| Idol card (any position) | 2 |
| Skeleton card (any position) | 0 |

### Game End
The game ends immediately when **any player has all 9 cards in their mine face-up** (fully revealed). All players then tally scores.

### Tiebreaker
The player with the **most consecutive cards of their favorite color** in their mine wins ties.

## Component List
- 54 Gem cards (numbered 1–9 in 6 colors)
- 42 Adventure cards (various action effects)
- 4 Skeleton cards
- 6 Player cards (indicating favorite colors)
- 1 Rulebook

## Errata & FAQ
- **Idol limit from hand:** You cannot play an Idol card from your hand if there is already one in your mine. However, it IS possible to end up with more than one idol through card swap/steal effects. — Source: BGA implementation notes
- **Hand refill:** Your hand refills to 3 at end of turn regardless of how many you played or discarded.

## Common Mistakes (ranked by frequency)
1. **Forgetting position numbering matters** — New players focus only on color matching and miss that position 1-9 alignment gives bonus points. — Source: BGA community
2. **Not understanding the swap mechanic** — When you play a gem card onto a face-down mine slot, the face-down card goes to your hand (now revealed to you). It's a swap, not a discard.
3. **Playing too many idols** — Only 1 idol can be played from hand. Additional idols only enter through card effects.
4. **Rushing to complete the mine** — Completing your mine ends the game, but doesn't guarantee a win. Better to optimize scoring.

## Teaching Order Recommendations
1. Start with the **goal** — fill your 3×3 mine for the most points
2. Explain the **scoring system** early — it drives all decisions
3. Show the **turn structure** — play up to 2 cards, discard, draw to 3
4. Explain **gem card placement** and the swap mechanic
5. Introduce **adventure cards** as actions that modify the game state
6. Cover **idols** and **skeletons** as special cards
7. Explain **game end trigger** — someone reveals all 9 cards
8. Setup comes last (it's simple enough)

## Game Analogies
- **Skyjo / Golf card game:** Very similar core loop — hidden grid of cards you're trying to optimize, reveal and swap. Dig Up Adventure adds more interaction with adventure cards.
- **Ticket to Ride (set collection):** Collecting matching colors for bonus points.
- **Memory (card game):** The hidden face-down mine cards create a memory element.
- **Uno (take-that):** Adventure cards that mess with opponents are similar to Draw 2 / Skip cards.

## Confusing Areas (from reviews)
- **When exactly do you draw?** — End of turn, back to 3. Some confusion about whether you draw during play.
- **Can you look at your own face-down cards?** — No, not unless an adventure card lets you peek.
- **What happens to a replaced face-up gem?** — It goes to the discard pile.
