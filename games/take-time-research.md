## Rules Summary

### Objective
Work together as a team to place 12 cards (Solar and Lunar, numbered 1–12 each) facedown around a clock with 6 segments. Each clock has specific rules that must be satisfied for the test to be passed. Complete all 40 tests (10 chapters × 4 clocks) to win the game.

### Universal Clock Rules (Apply to Every Clock)
1. Each of the 6 segments must contain **at least 1 card**
2. The total value of each segment must be **equal to or greater than** the previous segment (ascending clockwise from the clock hand)
3. No segment may total **more than 24**

### Three Phases Per Test

#### Phase 1: Discussion
- Players examine the clock and its specific rules
- Players **cannot look at the faces of their cards** — only the backs are visible (showing Sun or Moon color)
- Open discussion is allowed: strategize about general approach, who starts, where to invest high/low values
- **FORBIDDEN:** Using or devising codes, signals, or gestures to communicate card-specific information (e.g., "If I scratch my ear, that means I have an 8")
- Examples of legal discussion: "I think we should aim for low values on segments 1-2" or "Someone should put a big card on segment 6"

#### Phase 2: Card Placement
- Once discussion is finished, players **pick up and look at their cards**
- **All communication ends completely** — no speaking, no sign language, no gestures, no raised eyebrows
- Any player may place the first card; then play proceeds clockwise
- Each player places **one card at a time** into any segment, face down by default
- Players may collectively place a limited number of cards **face up** (determined by the Reminder token + Bonus tokens)
- The decision to play a card face up **cannot be openly discussed** during this phase
- Continue until all 12 cards have been played

#### Phase 3: Resolution
- Starting with the segment denoted by the clock hand, reveal each facedown card without changing card order
- Calculate the sum of cards in each segment
- Verify: (1) at least 1 card per segment, (2) ascending totals, (3) no segment exceeds 24, (4) all special rules satisfied
- If all conditions met → **PASS** (move to next clock)
- If any condition fails → **FAIL** (see retry rules)

### Card Distribution by Player Count
Total: 24 cards (12 Solar + 12 Lunar), shuffled together. Deal 12 cards total:

- **2 Players:** Each player gets two groups — a stack of 4 cards and a stack of 2 cards. Players only pick up the 4-card stack at the start of Placement. After both players have played 2 cards from their hand, they pick up the remaining 2-card stack.
- **3 Players:** Each player receives 4 cards.
- **4 Players:** Each player receives 3 cards (or possibly split similar to 2-player with stacks of varying size — sources slightly vary).

Note: The remaining 12 cards (not dealt) are not used in that test.

### Reminder Tokens & Face-Up Cards
- Place the Reminder token matching your player count near the play area
- The number of eye symbols (👁) on the Reminder token = how many cards can be played face up collectively by the group
- Face-up card placements can be shared freely among players but the decision **cannot be discussed** during the Placement Phase

### Bonus Tokens (Retry Mechanism)
- 3 Bonus tokens start face down
- When you **fail** a test, flip 1 Bonus token face up
- Each face-up Bonus token allows the group to play **1 additional face-up card** on subsequent attempts
- Once the test is **passed**, all Bonus tokens flip back face down

### Skipping Tests — Sleeve of Regrets
- If a test is too difficult, you may skip it
- Flip any face-up Bonus tokens back face down
- Place the clock into the **Sleeve of Regrets**
- You may return to skipped tests later

### Clock-Specific Rules
Each clock adds unique constraints beyond the universal rules:
- Segments may require a specific number of cards (e.g., "exactly 3 cards")
- Segments may only accept certain card types (e.g., "Solar cards only")
- Segments may have maximum/minimum value constraints
- Center rules apply to ALL segments on that clock
- The clock hand indicates which segment is the "starting segment" for ascending order

### Completing the Game
- Pass all 40 tests to complete the game
- After attempting all tests (pass or fail), you may open the **Rebirth sleeve** for additional content

### Rebirth Sleeve
Contains: 1 Second Hand + 6 tokens for additional variability and challenge

## Component List
- 1 Rulebook
- 12 Solar Cards (numbered 1–12, distinct back color)
- 12 Lunar Cards (numbered 1–12, distinct back color)
- 1 Clock Hand
- 3 Reminder Tokens (one per player count: 2P, 3P, 4P)
- 3 Bonus Tokens
- 10 Chapter Sleeves (each containing 4 Clocks + 1 Rules Sheet)
- 1 Sleeve of Regrets
- 1 Rebirth Sleeve (containing 1 Second Hand + 6 Tokens)

## Errata & FAQ
No dedicated official FAQ or errata found as of research date. The game is relatively new (Oct 2025). Key clarifications from the rulebook and community:

1. **You cannot look at cards during Discussion Phase.** Cards are dealt but remain face down. You can only see card backs (Sun vs Moon color).
2. **Communication prohibition is absolute during Placement.** No speaking, gesturing, signals, or codes of any kind.
3. **Face-up cards can be used strategically as signals.** Playing a card face up communicates its value to teammates — this is the intended strategic depth.
4. **Card backs are visible information.** You can see whether a card is Solar or Lunar from its back. This is legal information to use during the Discussion phase and to observe during Placement.

## Common Mistakes (ranked by frequency)
1. **Looking at cards during Discussion** — Players instinctively look at their cards when dealt them. You MUST NOT look during the Discussion phase. Only backs are visible. — Source: Multiple reviews and rulebook emphasis
2. **Talking during Placement** — After the Discussion phase ends and you pick up your cards, absolutely no communication. Many groups slip up. — Source: Rulebook, multiple reviews
3. **Using secret codes/signals** — The rules explicitly forbid devised codes like "if I place my card at an angle, it's an 11" or ear-scratching to indicate values. — Source: Official rulebook
4. **Forgetting ascending order** — Values must be ascending (or equal) clockwise from the clock hand. Some players read segments in the wrong direction or forget this constraint. — Source: Community play reports
5. **Not understanding face-up card limit** — The Reminder token shows how many total face-up cards the group can play. It's a group limit, not per-player. Bonus tokens add to this limit after failures. — Source: Rulebook clarification
6. **2-player card pickup timing** — In 2-player games, you only pick up 4 of your 6 cards initially. The other 2 are picked up mid-round after playing 2 cards. — Source: Rulebook, whatsericplaying review

## Teaching Order Recommendations
Based on community guides and review analysis:

1. **Start with the concept** — You're solving clock puzzles together with limited communication
2. **Show a clock** — Explain the 6 segments and the universal rules (ascending, ≤24, at least 1 card each)
3. **Explain the three phases** — Discussion → Placement → Resolution
4. **Demonstrate the Discussion phase** — Emphasize: you can't look at your cards, only see Sun/Moon backs
5. **Demonstrate the Placement phase** — Emphasize: complete silence, place one card at a time clockwise
6. **Explain face-up cards** — Show the Reminder token, explain the strategic value
7. **Walk through Resolution** — Flip cards, check rules
8. **Cover failure/retry mechanics** — Bonus tokens, Sleeve of Regrets
9. **Then just start playing Chapter 1** — The first clocks are deliberately simple

The game's progressive difficulty (Chapter 1 is very simple) means you can teach the basics and let the game teach the rest through play.

## Game Analogies
- **The Mind:** Limited communication, playing numbered cards silently, building team synchronization — Take Time is often described as "The Mind but with more game"
- **The Crew:** Progressive campaign of cooperative card challenges with increasing difficulty and evolving rules — structural similarity
- **Hanabi:** Cooperative card game where you can't see your own cards (in Take Time's Discussion phase), information deduction from limited signals
- **Codenames Duet:** Cooperative game with limited communication where you must infer your partner's intentions from constrained actions

## Confusing Areas (from reviews)
- **The silence requirement** — Some groups find the strict no-communication rule during Placement hard to enforce. Reviewer recommendation: "add a soundtrack" to fill the silence.
- **Mathematical vs. intuitive play** — Some reviewers note the game can feel "very mechanical and mathematical" which is either a pro or a con depending on the player.
- **Bimodal reception** — "Opinions are fairly bimodal — it's either a great cooperative experience or it's felt to barely be a game." (Opinionated Gamers)
- **Theme is primarily aesthetic** — The poetic journey from "Awakening" to "Rebirth" is beautiful but loosely connected to the puzzle mechanics.
- **2-player card management** — The split-stack deal for 2 players is unintuitive and needs explicit explanation.
