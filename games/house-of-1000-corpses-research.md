## Rules Summary

### Overview
A cooperative game where players take on the roles of the Firefly family. The objective is to hunt victims hiding in the house and deliver them to Dr. Satan before the police arrive (4 action rounds). Players use an action card system that penalizes repeated use of the same action type.

### Game Structure
- **4 Action Rounds** (with 3 Recovery Rounds in between)
- Each action round: players take turns in initiative order, performing actions by spending adrenaline cubes
- Each recovery round: swap items, remove conditions, retrieve adrenaline, reset action chains

### Actions (4 types)
1. **Move** — Spend cubes to move character orthogonally through rooms
2. **Search** — Spend cubes to reveal face-down search cards in current room
3. **Kill** — Spend cubes to kill a victim or destroy a barrier (advances blood meter by 1)
4. **Capture** — Spend cubes to capture a victim (must escort off-board via porch to score)

### The Action Chain (Core Mechanic)
- Players have 5 slots for action cards arranged left-to-right
- Cards exit from the left, re-enter on the right
- The rightmost 4 slots have additional adrenaline costs
- This means repeating an action quickly costs more cubes (the card is farther right)
- Captured victims and conditions also enter the chain, increasing costs

### Search Card Types
- **Items**: Equip for ongoing bonuses or hold in hand
- **Conditions**: Negative effects — remove adrenaline cubes, add to action chain
- **Victims**: Draw a run card — victims try to escape or hide
- **Barriers**: Block searches in a room until destroyed
- **Rabbits**: Draw a run card — ALL non-player characters activate

### Running Mechanics
Victims run when: revealed during search, a rabbit is drawn, or at end of an action round.
- Run cards dictate movement: toward front porch, back porch, or hide in a room
- Victims move spaces equal to their strength value
- Corpse tokens slow victims (cost 1 movement each)
- If a victim reaches an exit, they escape
- **3 escaped victims = immediate loss**

### Lieutenant Wydell
- Law enforcement antagonist who moves via run cards
- Players in Wydell's space can ONLY take move actions
- Wydell causes victims to escape, removes corpses, discards barriers
- Only present in Normal and Nightmare difficulty

### Blood Meter (Victory Track)
- Killing a victim advances blood meter by 1
- Capturing and delivering a victim advances it further
- Killing also awards trophy cards equal to victim strength
- **Win condition**: Fill the blood meter before end of round 4

### Items & Trophies
- **Items**: One equipped at a time, ongoing action bonuses
- **Trophies**: Single-use cards for action boosts
- **Hand limit**: 5 combined items + trophies
- Players in the same space can trade freely

### Burning Action Cards
At any time, a player may remove an action card from their chain to either:
1. Move one adrenaline cube between rows, OR
2. Use the character's special ability
Burned cards return during recovery rounds.

### Difficulty Modes
- **Beginner**: No Lt. Wydell
- **Normal**: Standard rules with Wydell
- **Nightmare**: Harder blood meter track

### Solo/Player Count Rules
- 1 player: Controls 3 characters (1–3 player board)
- 2 players: Each controls 2 characters (2–4 player board)
- 3 players: One character each (1–3 player board)
- 4 players: One character each (2–4 player board)

## Component List
- 1 Dual-sided game board (1–3 players / 2–4 players)
- 8 Character standees with initiative markers
- 8 Player mats (4 standard + 4 Kickstarter exclusive dual-layer)
- 54 Adrenaline cubes
- 1 Blood meter marker
- 1 Round marker
- 65 Search cards (victims, items, conditions, barriers, rabbits)
- 30 Trophy cards
- 20 Run cards
- Corpse tokens
- 1 Lt. Wydell standee
- 4 sets of Action cards (Move, Search, Kill, Capture per player)

## Characters (Firefly Family)
- **Otis B. Driftwood** — Aggressive, likely combat-focused abilities
- **Baby Firefly** — Cunning, likely search or movement abilities
- **Captain Spaulding** — Showman, likely support or item abilities
- **Mother Firefly** — Matriarch, likely recovery or coordination abilities
- Additional characters available (8 total standees)

## Errata & FAQ
- BGG thread discusses whether trophies on top of search stacks are picked up by entering a room or by spending a search action
- Action chain mechanics cause the most rules questions — specifically, when captured victims enter the chain and how costs escalate

## Common Mistakes (ranked by frequency)
1. **Action chain cost escalation** — Forgetting that the rightmost slots have additional adrenaline costs
2. **Running mechanics** — Incorrectly resolving victim movement when run cards are drawn
3. **Wydell interactions** — Forgetting that Wydell causes captured victims to escape if he enters your space
4. **Seed deck vs. main deck** — Not properly constructing the two separate search decks during setup
5. **Burning action cards** — Forgetting this is available as a free action at any time

## Teaching Order Recommendations
1. Start with **theme and goal** — you're the Firefly family, hunt victims, fill the blood meter
2. Explain the **board layout** — rooms, connections, porches
3. Demonstrate the **action chain** — this is the core mechanic and most unique element
4. Walk through the **4 actions** (Move, Search, Kill, Capture) one at a time
5. Explain **search card types** and what happens when victims appear (running)
6. Cover the **blood meter** and how killing vs. capturing score differently
7. Introduce **Lt. Wydell** last (or skip for first game on Beginner)
8. Save **burning action cards** and **item/trophy management** for during play

## Game Analogies
- **Action chain** mechanic is similar to the rondel in games like **Concordia** — repeated actions cost more
- **Cooperative hunting** is similar to **Pandemic** — players spread out, manage a shared threat
- **Pick up and deliver** aspect recalls **Horrified** — find the monster/victim and bring them somewhere
- **Horror co-op theme** comparable to **Mansions of Madness** but playing as the villains

## Confusing Areas (from reviews)
- The action chain is the most unique and most confusing element for new players
- Setup with the seed deck construction takes some time to learn
- Run card resolution order can be tricky (activate characters top to bottom by strength)
- Understanding when to kill vs. capture requires strategic experience
